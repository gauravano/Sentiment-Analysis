Cybersecurity Month: Your heart could be the key to unlocking your computer,"Cybersecurity Month: Your heart could be the key to unlocking your computerNSF-supported technology in biometric securityResearch funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) is at the heart of this month’s 23rd Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Communication in Snowbird, Utah. NSF-supported researchers will present a paper, Cardiac Scan: A Non-contact and Continuous Heart-based User Authentication System highlighting a new biometric computer security device that measures the dimensions of the heart and uses this information as a personal identifier.“Heart-based biometrics systems have been used for almost a decade,” says Wenyao Xu of University of Buffalo, the paper’s lead author, in a recent news release issued by the university. But, he said “No one has done a non-contact remote device to characterize our hearts’ geometry traits for identification.”Image credit: Jurga Jot/Shutterstock.comCurrent biometrics rely on electrodes measuring electrocardiogram signals, which means they must physically touch users to obtain heart readings. An example of a device that requires physical contact is Nymi, a wearable wristband created in 2013 that recognizes a user’s unique cardiac rhythms.Xu’s device, called Cardiac Scan, uses low-level Doppler radar to measure the heart — its shape, size, and how it moves — to identify an individual.Every heart is unique. Xu’s device could relieve people’s concerns about leaving their computers unguarded because Cardiac Scan constantly monitors users. The computer will not operate if a different person is at the helm.“No two people with identical hearts have ever been found,” Xu said, and their hearts only change shape if they suffer from serious heart disease.The system’s radar is much weaker than Wi-Fi, which means that it’s not hazardous to a person’s health, Xu said.Image credit: Jackie Niam/Shutterstock.comXu believes Cardiac Scan could have many cybersecurity applications, including airport security, where a person could be monitored up to 30 meters away, potentially expediting the security process. The technology could also be used in cell phones to make identification less of a burden. Due to its passive nature, it doesn’t require physical contact with the phone.NSF-funded research such as Xu’s signals a more secure future for our property and identities, and has the potential to broaden the field of biometric security."
The European Commission Has a BAD Idea — Mandatory Biometric ID Cards,"The European Commission Has a BAD Idea — Mandatory Biometric ID CardsAfter Article 13 that mandates upload filters, the European Commission has another ill-advised proposal — now they want to make biometric data in ID cards mandatory for all member states.Counter-terrorism, security, blah-blah… I don’t doubt they may be meaning well, but the technical details are just too complicated for the average politician to comprehend (and our politicians are very average, if I may quote “Yes, Minister”).When I was advisor to the Bulgarian deputy prime minister I did extensive research on the issues of identity documents, as we were changing the Bulgarian legislation and had to decide whether it’s okay to have biometric ID cards or not (we decided to make them opt-in, which would mean practically nobody would go for that option). And I have listed the many issues with electronic machine readable travel documents (eMRTDs) but let me make a simplified overview of why the ICAO standard is bad (and I’m joined in this opinion by many security researchers, whose papers I’ve quoted in the linked article): the certificates and keys used to read the the fingerprints in the documents are stored in the terminal equipment (automatic or not) and are rotated frequently, because if they leak (and they can leak), then every passport in the world can be read with the single leaked key. And the fact that they are rotated frequently (which means — they are invalid after a day or two) doesn’t help, because the chips in passports don’t have clocks. If they are not validated often, they become stale and the fingerprints can be read by keys whose certificates have expired a long time ago.“But the chip is NFC and can be read only in close proximity” you may say. Wrong. There is equipment (that’s easy and cheap to make) that fits in a backpack that can read up to a few meters. So in practice — you walk around the metro/subway train and collect fingerprints. It is not that trivial, of course, it requires some brute-forcing and advanced knowledge of the ICAO protocol (guess what — chips can’t prevent brute-force attacks), but it is doable.So far I’ve talked about passports. The good thing about them is that you don’t carry them with you unless you are flying outside the EU. So very few people will have their passports on them at a given moment. They are still vulnerable in “train to the airport” scenarios, but passports are validated more often because you use them to cross borders.ID cards have none of these benefits. You carry them all the time and they never go through border inspections (within the Schengen area at least). So they almost always have stale clocks.Additionally, some countries may decide to make a fingerprint database when they collect the fingerprints of citizens for issuing the document. This database, no matter how well protected, can leak at some point. It is not technically required to have the database when issuing documents (you can write the fingerprint on the chip and then discard it), but some countries will inevitably store them unless explicitly restricted.What can happen if someone has your fingerprint? It was a bit disheartening when (at a conference) an expert in passports answered my concerns with “well, nothing bad can happen if someone gets your fingerprint — I can get your fingerprint from that glass you are holding”. You can, but it won’t be high-resolution and won’t allow you to make perfect fake fingerprints (and yes, it’s pretty easy to make fake fingerprints, and fingerprint-only identification is a horrible idea). And even if you could make a fake fingerprint, you won’t be able to easily automate the process if you used glasses.But what can you do with those? A few things to begin with — unlock stolen phones, unlock access doors (including home doors — there are fingerprint locks already on the market). When you unlock a stolen phone, you have access to everything — email (which can be used to gain access to most services), the 2nd factor in most 2-factor authentications, for e-banking for example. The worse thing is that you can’t change your fingerprint. And anything that relies on it is compromised forever. Your next smartphone. And the one after it. There’s no “invalidate fingerprint” option.The general data protection and human rights argument is also here — having databases (whether centrally leaked or illegally collected) of biometric data is dystopian. And bad. Period.But…but…counter-terrorism? Ah, yes, let’s get to that. Fingerprints won’t help. I’d be happy to see some analysis and threat models when the actual proposal is published, but I don’t think fingerprints solve any actual problem.So what are the potential scenarios? A terrorists forges a document, a terrorist gets issued a fake document from a rogue/compromised state, a terrorist steals a document. Let’s see whether fingerprints in the document help and whether they are needed in each scenario. But first a clarification — the fingerprints in the document would be needed in order to verify that the holder of the document is actually the person to whom the document is originally issued. You match the fingerprints of the holder to the fingerprints in the document. This is the only thing the fingerprints in a document are good for. So:a terrorists forges a document —if the documents has any electronic data in it, signed with the private key of the issuing country, nobody can create a fake document because it won’t pass the signature validation. You don’t need fingerprints for that, you can sign the name and birth date.a terrorist gets issued a fake document from a rogue/compromised state — if a terrorist can have a document issued with a genuine private key from an actual country, then they can issue perfectly valid document under a fake name with the actual fingerprints and pass fingerprint verification. How about checking the fingerprints against a database? Well, you don’t need them in the document — you have the person in front of you, giving their fingerprints for inspection anyway.a terrorist steals a document — in that case, upon inspection, the fingerprints in the document won’t match the ones of the person. So maybe this is the actual use? Well, you don’t need them here either. There’s the photo (which I have no objections to being stored) which should also match. Yes, both automatic and human inspections can be fooled with similarly-looking people, but how likely is it? Also, stolen and lost documents are normally reported (not all of them, though) and are/can be distributed in central databases of invalid documents.Only in the last case there’s some room for fingerprints. But when would the inspection be done? At airpoirts — on arrival you can go through automatic gates and use fake fingerprint anyway, so that’s not something you are solving. On departure — you are checked for dangerous items anyway, so even with a fake document you should not be able to crash a plane. I’m reminding again that in Schengen there’s no border checks, so the only way someone can inspect your ID cards would be for police officers to be patrolling railway and bus stations and asking strangers to give their fingerprints. Which means they will have to carry fingerprint readers (with the short-lived key+certificate).When I was in the cabinet we mailed both ICAO and the European Commission most of the above concerns. The responses we got were … disappointing. The Commission replied: “We haven’t had problems so far”. Best. Security. Approach. Ever. “We haven’t had problems, therefore it’s secure”. No.ICAO showed more understanding and replied “Thank you, can you recommend an expert for a working group” (we didn’t for various reasons out of the scope of this article).This brings me to the bigger issue with legislation that requires technical expertise. Political decisions should be taken with the details in mind. The “general overview” and the “executive summary” are not sufficient when it comes to affecting millions of citizens.I hope I’m missing something. But my hunch is that this is all nonsense which will hopefully be killed by the European Parliament."
Biometric technology: Looking to the future,"Biometric technology: Looking to the futureWelcome to Threat Intel’s #WednesdayWisdom column, which aims to help improve your cyber security knowledge and keep you informed on important developments.Issues around the security, reliability, and privacy of biometric technology were catapulted into the headlines recently when Apple introduced its new iPhone X to the masses at its annual event in California.The iPhone X is the first iPhone to utilize facial recognition technology, and its introduction has led to both privacy and security experts expressing concerns that using this technology might make it easier for people — including law enforcement and border control officials, as well as potentially hackers — to unlock people’s phones, potentially against their will.Apple, of course, disputes this, and also says that the chances of a random person being able to unlock your phone with their face is one in a million.However, its introduction has brought to the fore again questions about biometric technology, and how secure it may be if used for things like unlocking your phone or making payments in shops.What is biometric technology?Dictionary.com defines biometrics as “the process by which a person’s unique physical and other traits are detected and recorded by an electronic device or system as a means of confirming identity.”Apple’s move into using facial recognition is far from the first time we have seen biometrics being used as a security feature on mobile phones — the iPhone fingerprint scanner, which will be replaced on the iPhone X by the facial recognition technology, has been a feature on the iPhone since the launch of the iPhone 5s in 2013. That is something that many of us got so used to that it will be a wrench for it to be replaced with new technology, demonstrating, perhaps, how quickly the public can adapt to new types of authentication.However, as there were security concerns around fingerprint scanning technology, which it was possible to spoof, there will also be concerns about facial recognition technology. Iris scanning technology and facial recognition technology on Samsung’s S8 smartphone were both cracked by researchers using photographs. This highlights one of the main issues some people have pointed out about using facial recognition for security: unlike your fingerprint, people can see your face when they’re in your presence, and it is likely many photos of it exist online. This prompts some questions: could someone unlock your phone with a photo? Could people restrain you and hold up your phone to your face and unlock it that way?Apple has said that its Face ID technology means that a person’s phone could not simply be unlocked with a photograph: the iPhone uses an infrared system to project a grid of 30,000 invisible light dots onto a person’s face to map it in a 3D shape. You also have to look at the phone for it to unlock, so you could not hold it up to the face of its sleeping owner to unlock it. However, while this technology certainly sounds more secure than what has gone before it, it doesn’t guarantee it is unhackable. The real test of it will be when the iPhone X becomes broadly available and researchers and others have a chance to test its security.Another concern around the use of biometric technology on mobile phones, which also applied to the existing fingerprint technology on so many phones, is that the law about whether or not you can be obligated by a member of the authorities to unlock your phone is a grey area. It has been established in the courts in the U.S. that, under the Fifth Amendment, an individual cannot be forced to reveal the PIN that will unlock their phone, but whether or not they can refuse to unlock it using biometrics has not been definitively established.Ultimately, while the ability to unlock devices using biometrics may offer greater convenience, it is not as secure as protecting your phone with a complex and unique PIN. If privacy is your concern, then a secure PIN is probably still the best way to protect your phone. However, it should be noted that, in the UK, convictions have been brought against individuals who have refused to hand over their passcodes when entering the country.Be still my beating heartMobile phones are far from the only area in which we are seeing biometrics being used for authentication and security.Some researchers have also recently put forth the idea of using your heartbeat to log in to computers and mobile phones. In 2015, MasterCard and Canadian biometrics company Nymi completed the first “in the wild” credit card transaction that was authenticated by reading the user’s unique heartbeat pattern. The transaction was carried out using Nymi’s dedicated payments authentication wristband. The company has claimed the technology could be built into other fitness trackers and smartwatches, and it says it can be used anywhere that accepts contactless payments.MasterCard is somewhat at the forefront when it comes to trialing ways to use biometrics to authenticate payments. At Mobile World Congress last year it introduced the idea of “selfie payments”, where users would take a selfie to authenticate their identity. It included this software as part of its Identity Check Mobile rollout in a number of European markets in late 2016.Ears, which have distinct characteristics unique to an individual, have also been mooted as a part of the body that could be used as a unique identifier, and even as a way to authenticate payments.Another recent story that raised eyebrows and inspired headlines was when a company microchipped its employees to allow them to scan into their offices and do things like purchase food without needing anything as old fashioned as an access card.So, will biometrics and microchipping eventually mean that we no longer need passwords or ID cards and our body will literally be what identifies us? Time will tell.However, while the advantages of biometrics are, of course, that they are much harder to guess or spoof, the problems are that if your biometric identity is compromised somehow there is little you can do about it — it is a lot more difficult to change your face, heartbeat, or gait than a password.Predicting the futureAs biometric technology advances, many people are naturally asking what will be next? In the always fast-moving world of tech it is hard to say. But some observers have speculated that Apple’s face tracking will lead to people becoming more accustomed to having their faces tracked, with the potential in the future to have technology that not only recognizes your face, but could perhaps even predict how you are feeling from your facial expression.However, the Minority Report style future that sort of speculation brings to mind is probably still some time away.For now, for those purchasing the iPhone X, the best advice is probably not to put all your eggs in the facial recognition basket, but to also ensure you have a good password enabled to keep your phone secure.Don’t put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to mobile phone securityCheck out the Security Response blog and follow Threat Intel on Twitter to keep up-to-date with the latest happenings in the world of threat intelligence and cybersecurity.Like this story?

The World’s First Biometric Password Lockdown App is here,"The World’s First Biometric Password Lockdown App is hereIt’s about time: a biometric for your smartphone that will change the way you think about biometric security.This revolutionary biometric comes from Biometric Signature ID and it’s called BioTect-ID, and though it’s a biometric, it does not involve any so-called invasiveness of collecting body part information. The world’s first biometric password involves multi-factor authentication and just your finger — but not prints!All you need to make this technology work to lock down your mobile device is a four-character password. But you can also draw a symbol like a star, leaf, a shining sun or smiley face as your password.So suppose your password is PTy5 or a star. And suppose the wrong person learns this. In order for that person to get into your locked phone, they will have to literally move their finger exactly as you did to draw the “PTy5” or the star. This will be impossible.BioTect-ID’s technology captures your finger’s movements, its gestures, and this biometric can’t be stolen or replicated.BioTect-ID doesn’t stop there, however. The finger gesture biometric is only one component of the overall security. You’ve probably heard of “two-factor” authentication. This is when, in addition to typing in your password or answering a security question, you receive a text, phone call or e-mail showing a one-time numerical security code. You use that code to gain access. But this system can be circumvented by hackers.And the traditional biometrics such as fingerprints and voice recognition can actually be stolen and copied. So if, say, your fingerprint is obtained and replicated by a cyber thief…how do you replace that? A different finger? What if eventually, the prints of all fingers are stolen? Then what? Or how do you replace your voice or face biometrics?Biometrics are strong security because they work. But they have that downside. It’s pretty scary.BioTect-ID solves this problem because you can replace your password with a new password, providing a new finger gesture to capture, courtesy of the patented software BioSig-ID™. Your finger movement, when drawing the password, involves:SpeedDirectionHeightLengthWidthAnd more, including if you write your password backwards or outside the gridlines.Encryption software stores these unique-to-you features.Now, you might be wondering how the user can replicate their own drawing on subsequent password entries. The user does not need to struggle to replicate the exact appearance of the password, such as the loop on the capital L. Dynamic biometrics captures the user’s movement pattern.So even though the loop in the L on the next password entry is a bit smaller or longer than the preceding one, the movement or gesture will match up with the one used during the enrollment. Thus, if a crook seemingly duplicates your L loop and other characters as far as appearance, his gestures will not match yours — and he won’t be able to unlock the phone.In fact, the Tolly Group ran a test. Subjects were given the passwords. None of the 10,000 login attempts replicated the original user’s finger movements. Just because two passwords look drawn the same doesn’t mean they were created with identical finger gestures. Your unique gesture comes automatically without thinking — kind of like the way you walk or talk. The Tolly test’s accuracy was 99.97 percent.Now doesn’t this all sound much more appealing than the possibility that some POS out there will steal your palm print — something you cannot replace?Let’s get BioTect-ID’s technology out there so everyone knows about this groundbreaking advance in security. Here is what you’ll achieve:You’ll be the first to benefit from this hack-proof technologyYou’ll have peace of mind like you’ve never had beforeEliminated possible exposure of your body parts data kept in filesYou can actually receive early edition copies of the app for reduced prices and get insider information if you become a backer on Kickstarter for a couple of bucks.

3 Industries that Need iTrue’s Biometric Authentication System,"3 Industries that Need iTrue’s Biometric Authentication SystemThere is a growing demand for safe, efficient, and secure authentication systems, given the rise of online financial products and startup companies providing innovative digital services. Many organizations are already exploring or implementing biometrics as the optimal way of authenticating users in order to reduce the risk of security breaches.However, biometric technologies alone cannot give absolute assurance of secure and safe authentication since user data can easily be compromised or misused with improper handling. iTrue solves this issue by putting confidential data on the blockchain and securing it with biometrics. Thus, offering users a safe location to store data as well as a platform to verify identities without fear of compromise. The use case of iTrue’s decentralized platform spans across many industries, but the major ones are banking and finance, healthcare and government.Banking and FinanceBanking and finance is expected to be the number one driver for growth in biometric technologies, as banks realize passwords and pins are no longer a sufficient security barrier. Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at Bank of America, told The Charlotte Observer, “passwords need to go away” because “number 1, people forget them and, number 2, they’re not safe.”A report from Global Market Insights predicts that use of biometric technology within financial services will grow by 22 percent per year between 2017 and 2024.Fingerprint recognitionAccording to the American Banker, more than half of Bank of America’s users had used fingerprint biometrics for mobile access by 2017.Eye recognitionAccording to Fortune, dozens of regional banks and credit unions, including Wells Fargo, have already enabled app sign-on via eye recognition.Facial recognitionFor iPhone X users, U.S. Bank and Citibank offer facial ID login to their mobile banking portals given that iPhone X doesn’t support fingerprint login.Biometric identification is used by banks and other financial institutions to know exactly ‘who’ is using the services they are offering and also for documenting customers’ activities. With so many options available for biometric identification, banks are even moving towards offering multifactor authentication allowing customers to provide a combination of biometric identifiers (i.e. fingerprint and eye scans) to reduce the potential of fraud even further.Key use cases for financial institutions:· Customer identification· Employee identification· KYC compliance· ATM access· Mobile banking accessHealthcareHealthcare biometrics refers to biometric applications in doctors’ offices, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities for use in monitoring patients, but also for healthcare insurance and patient record keeping.To start, healthcare professionals spend a lot of time on patient identification, record keeping and retrieval of patient records. These processes can be streamlined with biometric authentication as a single facial scan can pull up all related patient data, saving valuable time that can be spent providing care and treatment to other patients.According to the BMJ, hospital medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States.Furthermore, emergency patients are often unconscious and cannot produce an ID or answer critical questions like drug-related allergies or current medications. Traditional patient tagging is full of vulnerabilities and a simple error can lead to loss of life, therefore keeping this process free from flaws becomes mandatory. Biometric identification can help achieve this level of accuracy in patient identification.A hospital has many areas where only doctors and staff should enter. Biometrics can help prevent unauthorized access to critical areas such as operating rooms or PCs that contain confidential patient records.Key use cases for healthcare facilities:· Patient access control· Patient identification· Patient tagging· Workforce management· Healthcare insurance· Patient record storageGovernmentBiometrics has received increased attention since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and has intensified over time due to mass shootings and other dangerous happenings around the world. Governments are increasingly turning to biometrics in an attempt to increase security at airports and border crossings, and to produce more secure identity documents. Some governments are even relying on biometric technology to verify voters during government elections.In the summer of 2018, Heathrow Airport travellers faced huge queues of up to 2.5 hours when going through passport control and securityMoreover, governments deal with a lot of confidential documents that are currently stored in centralized locations and servers. All this confidential data — including biometric data — can be stolen or tampered with if the single location were ever compromised by intruders.Key use cases for governments:· National identification programs (i.e. India, United Kingdom)· Public food distribution systems (i.e. India, Venezuela)· ePassports (i.e. Canada, United States)· Voters’ enrollment (i.e. Brazil, Portugal)· Border control (i.e. Canada, United States)· Prisons and detention centers (i.e. United States, United Kingdom)"

The European Commission Has a BAD Idea — Mandatory Biometric ID Cards,"The European Commission Has a BAD Idea — Mandatory Biometric ID CardsAfter Article 13 that mandates upload filters, the European Commission has another ill-advised proposal — now they want to make biometric data in ID cards mandatory for all member states.Counter-terrorism, security, blah-blah… I don’t doubt they may be meaning well, but the technical details are just too complicated for the average politician to comprehend (and our politicians are very average, if I may quote “Yes, Minister”).When I was advisor to the Bulgarian deputy prime minister I did extensive research on the issues of identity documents, as we were changing the Bulgarian legislation and had to decide whether it’s okay to have biometric ID cards or not (we decided to make them opt-in, which would mean practically nobody would go for that option). And I have listed the many issues with electronic machine readable travel documents (eMRTDs) but let me make a simplified overview of why the ICAO standard is bad (and I’m joined in this opinion by many security researchers, whose papers I’ve quoted in the linked article): the certificates and keys used to read the the fingerprints in the documents are stored in the terminal equipment (automatic or not) and are rotated frequently, because if they leak (and they can leak), then every passport in the world can be read with the single leaked key. And the fact that they are rotated frequently (which means — they are invalid after a day or two) doesn’t help, because the chips in passports don’t have clocks. If they are not validated often, they become stale and the fingerprints can be read by keys whose certificates have expired a long time ago.“But the chip is NFC and can be read only in close proximity” you may say. Wrong. There is equipment (that’s easy and cheap to make) that fits in a backpack that can read up to a few meters. So in practice — you walk around the metro/subway train and collect fingerprints. It is not that trivial, of course, it requires some brute-forcing and advanced knowledge of the ICAO protocol (guess what — chips can’t prevent brute-force attacks), but it is doable.So far I’ve talked about passports. The good thing about them is that you don’t carry them with you unless you are flying outside the EU. So very few people will have their passports on them at a given moment. They are still vulnerable in “train to the airport” scenarios, but passports are validated more often because you use them to cross borders.ID cards have none of these benefits. You carry them all the time and they never go through border inspections (within the Schengen area at least). So they almost always have stale clocks.Additionally, some countries may decide to make a fingerprint database when they collect the fingerprints of citizens for issuing the document. This database, no matter how well protected, can leak at some point. It is not technically required to have the database when issuing documents (you can write the fingerprint on the chip and then discard it), but some countries will inevitably store them unless explicitly restricted.What can happen if someone has your fingerprint? It was a bit disheartening when (at a conference) an expert in passports answered my concerns with “well, nothing bad can happen if someone gets your fingerprint — I can get your fingerprint from that glass you are holding”. You can, but it won’t be high-resolution and won’t allow you to make perfect fake fingerprints (and yes, it’s pretty easy to make fake fingerprints, and fingerprint-only identification is a horrible idea). And even if you could make a fake fingerprint, you won’t be able to easily automate the process if you used glasses.But what can you do with those? A few things to begin with — unlock stolen phones, unlock access doors (including home doors — there are fingerprint locks already on the market). When you unlock a stolen phone, you have access to everything — email (which can be used to gain access to most services), the 2nd factor in most 2-factor authentications, for e-banking for example. The worse thing is that you can’t change your fingerprint. And anything that relies on it is compromised forever. Your next smartphone. And the one after it. There’s no “invalidate fingerprint” option.The general data protection and human rights argument is also here — having databases (whether centrally leaked or illegally collected) of biometric data is dystopian. And bad. Period.But…but…counter-terrorism? Ah, yes, let’s get to that. Fingerprints won’t help. I’d be happy to see some analysis and threat models when the actual proposal is published, but I don’t think fingerprints solve any actual problem.So what are the potential scenarios? A terrorists forges a document, a terrorist gets issued a fake document from a rogue/compromised state, a terrorist steals a document. Let’s see whether fingerprints in the document help and whether they are needed in each scenario. But first a clarification — the fingerprints in the document would be needed in order to verify that the holder of the document is actually the person to whom the document is originally issued. You match the fingerprints of the holder to the fingerprints in the document. This is the only thing the fingerprints in a document are good for. So:a terrorists forges a document —if the documents has any electronic data in it, signed with the private key of the issuing country, nobody can create a fake document because it won’t pass the signature validation. You don’t need fingerprints for that, you can sign the name and birth date.a terrorist gets issued a fake document from a rogue/compromised state — if a terrorist can have a document issued with a genuine private key from an actual country, then they can issue perfectly valid document under a fake name with the actual fingerprints and pass fingerprint verification. How about checking the fingerprints against a database? Well, you don’t need them in the document — you have the person in front of you, giving their fingerprints for inspection anyway.a terrorist steals a document — in that case, upon inspection, the fingerprints in the document won’t match the ones of the person. So maybe this is the actual use? Well, you don’t need them here either. There’s the photo (which I have no objections to being stored) which should also match. Yes, both automatic and human inspections can be fooled with similarly-looking people, but how likely is it? Also, stolen and lost documents are normally reported (not all of them, though) and are/can be distributed in central databases of invalid documents.Only in the last case there’s some room for fingerprints. But when would the inspection be done? At airpoirts — on arrival you can go through automatic gates and use fake fingerprint anyway, so that’s not something you are solving. On departure — you are checked for dangerous items anyway, so even with a fake document you should not be able to crash a plane. I’m reminding again that in Schengen there’s no border checks, so the only way someone can inspect your ID cards would be for police officers to be patrolling railway and bus stations and asking strangers to give their fingerprints. Which means they will have to carry fingerprint readers (with the short-lived key+certificate).When I was in the cabinet we mailed both ICAO and the European Commission most of the above concerns. The responses we got were … disappointing. The Commission replied: “We haven’t had problems so far”. Best. Security. Approach. Ever. “We haven’t had problems, therefore it’s secure”. No.ICAO showed more understanding and replied “Thank you, can you recommend an expert for a working group” (we didn’t for various reasons out of the scope of this article).This brings me to the bigger issue with legislation that requires technical expertise. Political decisions should be taken with the details in mind. The “general overview” and the “executive summary” are not sufficient when it comes to affecting millions of citizens.I hope I’m missing something. But my hunch is that this is all nonsense which will hopefully be killed by the European Parliament."
Biometric technology: Looking to the future,"Biometric technology: Looking to the futureWelcome to Threat Intel’s #WednesdayWisdom column, which aims to help improve your cyber security knowledge and keep you informed on important developments.Issues around the security, reliability, and privacy of biometric technology were catapulted into the headlines recently when Apple introduced its new iPhone X to the masses at its annual event in California.The iPhone X is the first iPhone to utilize facial recognition technology, and its introduction has led to both privacy and security experts expressing concerns that using this technology might make it easier for people — including law enforcement and border control officials, as well as potentially hackers — to unlock people’s phones, potentially against their will.Apple, of course, disputes this, and also says that the chances of a random person being able to unlock your phone with their face is one in a million.However, its introduction has brought to the fore again questions about biometric technology, and how secure it may be if used for things like unlocking your phone or making payments in shops.What is biometric technology?Dictionary.com defines biometrics as “the process by which a person’s unique physical and other traits are detected and recorded by an electronic device or system as a means of confirming identity.”Apple’s move into using facial recognition is far from the first time we have seen biometrics being used as a security feature on mobile phones — the iPhone fingerprint scanner, which will be replaced on the iPhone X by the facial recognition technology, has been a feature on the iPhone since the launch of the iPhone 5s in 2013. That is something that many of us got so used to that it will be a wrench for it to be replaced with new technology, demonstrating, perhaps, how quickly the public can adapt to new types of authentication.However, as there were security concerns around fingerprint scanning technology, which it was possible to spoof, there will also be concerns about facial recognition technology. Iris scanning technology and facial recognition technology on Samsung’s S8 smartphone were both cracked by researchers using photographs. This highlights one of the main issues some people have pointed out about using facial recognition for security: unlike your fingerprint, people can see your face when they’re in your presence, and it is likely many photos of it exist online. This prompts some questions: could someone unlock your phone with a photo? Could people restrain you and hold up your phone to your face and unlock it that way?Apple has said that its Face ID technology means that a person’s phone could not simply be unlocked with a photograph: the iPhone uses an infrared system to project a grid of 30,000 invisible light dots onto a person’s face to map it in a 3D shape. You also have to look at the phone for it to unlock, so you could not hold it up to the face of its sleeping owner to unlock it. However, while this technology certainly sounds more secure than what has gone before it, it doesn’t guarantee it is unhackable. The real test of it will be when the iPhone X becomes broadly available and researchers and others have a chance to test its security.Another concern around the use of biometric technology on mobile phones, which also applied to the existing fingerprint technology on so many phones, is that the law about whether or not you can be obligated by a member of the authorities to unlock your phone is a grey area. It has been established in the courts in the U.S. that, under the Fifth Amendment, an individual cannot be forced to reveal the PIN that will unlock their phone, but whether or not they can refuse to unlock it using biometrics has not been definitively established.Ultimately, while the ability to unlock devices using biometrics may offer greater convenience, it is not as secure as protecting your phone with a complex and unique PIN. If privacy is your concern, then a secure PIN is probably still the best way to protect your phone. However, it should be noted that, in the UK, convictions have been brought against individuals who have refused to hand over their passcodes when entering the country.Be still my beating heartMobile phones are far from the only area in which we are seeing biometrics being used for authentication and security.Some researchers have also recently put forth the idea of using your heartbeat to log in to computers and mobile phones. In 2015, MasterCard and Canadian biometrics company Nymi completed the first “in the wild” credit card transaction that was authenticated by reading the user’s unique heartbeat pattern. The transaction was carried out using Nymi’s dedicated payments authentication wristband. The company has claimed the technology could be built into other fitness trackers and smartwatches, and it says it can be used anywhere that accepts contactless payments.MasterCard is somewhat at the forefront when it comes to trialing ways to use biometrics to authenticate payments. At Mobile World Congress last year it introduced the idea of “selfie payments”, where users would take a selfie to authenticate their identity. It included this software as part of its Identity Check Mobile rollout in a number of European markets in late 2016.Ears, which have distinct characteristics unique to an individual, have also been mooted as a part of the body that could be used as a unique identifier, and even as a way to authenticate payments.Another recent story that raised eyebrows and inspired headlines was when a company microchipped its employees to allow them to scan into their offices and do things like purchase food without needing anything as old fashioned as an access card.So, will biometrics and microchipping eventually mean that we no longer need passwords or ID cards and our body will literally be what identifies us? Time will tell.However, while the advantages of biometrics are, of course, that they are much harder to guess or spoof, the problems are that if your biometric identity is compromised somehow there is little you can do about it — it is a lot more difficult to change your face, heartbeat, or gait than a password.Predicting the futureAs biometric technology advances, many people are naturally asking what will be next? In the always fast-moving world of tech it is hard to say. But some observers have speculated that Apple’s face tracking will lead to people becoming more accustomed to having their faces tracked, with the potential in the future to have technology that not only recognizes your face, but could perhaps even predict how you are feeling from your facial expression.However, the Minority Report style future that sort of speculation brings to mind is probably still some time away.For now, for those purchasing the iPhone X, the best advice is probably not to put all your eggs in the facial recognition basket, but to also ensure you have a good password enabled to keep your phone secure.Don’t put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to mobile phone securityCheck out the Security Response blog and follow Threat Intel on Twitter to keep up-to-date with the latest happenings in the world of threat intelligence and cybersecurity.Like this story?

3 Industries that Need iTrue’s Biometric Authentication System,"3 Industries that Need iTrue’s Biometric Authentication SystemThere is a growing demand for safe, efficient, and secure authentication systems, given the rise of online financial products and startup companies providing innovative digital services. Many organizations are already exploring or implementing biometrics as the optimal way of authenticating users in order to reduce the risk of security breaches.However, biometric technologies alone cannot give absolute assurance of secure and safe authentication since user data can easily be compromised or misused with improper handling. iTrue solves this issue by putting confidential data on the blockchain and securing it with biometrics. Thus, offering users a safe location to store data as well as a platform to verify identities without fear of compromise. The use case of iTrue’s decentralized platform spans across many industries, but the major ones are banking and finance, healthcare and government.Banking and FinanceBanking and finance is expected to be the number one driver for growth in biometric technologies, as banks realize passwords and pins are no longer a sufficient security barrier. Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at Bank of America, told The Charlotte Observer, “passwords need to go away” because “number 1, people forget them and, number 2, they’re not safe.”A report from Global Market Insights predicts that use of biometric technology within financial services will grow by 22 percent per year between 2017 and 2024.Fingerprint recognitionAccording to the American Banker, more than half of Bank of America’s users had used fingerprint biometrics for mobile access by 2017.Eye recognitionAccording to Fortune, dozens of regional banks and credit unions, including Wells Fargo, have already enabled app sign-on via eye recognition.Facial recognitionFor iPhone X users, U.S. Bank and Citibank offer facial ID login to their mobile banking portals given that iPhone X doesn’t support fingerprint login.Biometric identification is used by banks and other financial institutions to know exactly ‘who’ is using the services they are offering and also for documenting customers’ activities. With so many options available for biometric identification, banks are even moving towards offering multifactor authentication allowing customers to provide a combination of biometric identifiers (i.e. fingerprint and eye scans) to reduce the potential of fraud even further.Key use cases for financial institutions:· Customer identification· Employee identification· KYC compliance· ATM access· Mobile banking accessHealthcareHealthcare biometrics refers to biometric applications in doctors’ offices, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities for use in monitoring patients, but also for healthcare insurance and patient record keeping.To start, healthcare professionals spend a lot of time on patient identification, record keeping and retrieval of patient records. These processes can be streamlined with biometric authentication as a single facial scan can pull up all related patient data, saving valuable time that can be spent providing care and treatment to other patients.According to the BMJ, hospital medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States.Furthermore, emergency patients are often unconscious and cannot produce an ID or answer critical questions like drug-related allergies or current medications. Traditional patient tagging is full of vulnerabilities and a simple error can lead to loss of life, therefore keeping this process free from flaws becomes mandatory. Biometric identification can help achieve this level of accuracy in patient identification.A hospital has many areas where only doctors and staff should enter. Biometrics can help prevent unauthorized access to critical areas such as operating rooms or PCs that contain confidential patient records.Key use cases for healthcare facilities:· Patient access control· Patient identification· Patient tagging· Workforce management· Healthcare insurance· Patient record storageGovernmentBiometrics has received increased attention since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and has intensified over time due to mass shootings and other dangerous happenings around the world. Governments are increasingly turning to biometrics in an attempt to increase security at airports and border crossings, and to produce more secure identity documents. Some governments are even relying on biometric technology to verify voters during government elections.In the summer of 2018, Heathrow Airport travellers faced huge queues of up to 2.5 hours when going through passport control and securityMoreover, governments deal with a lot of confidential documents that are currently stored in centralized locations and servers. All this confidential data — including biometric data — can be stolen or tampered with if the single location were ever compromised by intruders.Key use cases for governments:· National identification programs (i.e. India, United Kingdom)· Public food distribution systems (i.e. India, Venezuela)· ePassports (i.e. Canada, United States)· Voters’ enrollment (i.e. Brazil, Portugal)· Border control (i.e. Canada, United States)· Prisons and detention centers (i.e. United States, United Kingdom)"
Biometric Password Authentication In Future For Samsung Smartwatches,"Biometric Password Authentication In Future For Samsung SmartwatchesUsers might witness biometric passwords for Samsung wearables in the future, providing the security that can not be breached by anyone else.Samsung Electronics has never stayed behind when it comes to providing its customers with the best innovative technology today. It has never hesitated to bring out technology, which has not been witnessed before, and it might continue doing so in the years to come. There have been speculations that the South Korean tech giant might provide further the security to wearable lovers unbreachable by anyone but them; smart watches will consist of a biometric verification authentication.The Galaxy maker will provide security to its customers that will require only their vein patterns and pulse to get access to their wearables in the future. According to a patent filling to the Trademark Office, the tech company described a technology that will consist of light sensors with a camera sensor in order identify vein pattern of users and detects their pulse.This description of the system indicates that the Samsung smart watches will consist of a biometric-like security because the combo of a camera and a light sensor prove that biometric tech will be installed in the watches. This can go very well if the company plays its cards right, especially with the mobile payments application, providing users with the security they seek for in the day today.Digitalization has not just led to success but also boosted cybercrime to access user’s confidential and sensitive data for benefits. With technology of such a kind, it would be difficult to “apparently” hack such a device.Biometric verification will offer customization of users contact list with different ringtones once the user identification is verified. The function is highly similar to fingerprint scanner. Infrared technology might be used by Samsung to reach this goal, as this is the only technology that can identify the pattern of the user’s veins.Previous speculations of patents suggested Samsung might use the user’s heartbeat as a verification tool but that would be very hard and unreliable. Heartbeat can vary from time to time depending on the situation and condition of a person. This would be an ‘awkward’ situation for the South Korean organization but the recent speculation seems reliable, as veins cannot change under any circumstance.Samsung device detects veins by the smart watch if the user is wearing one, indicating that this biometric tech will relieve the owner in terms of security of their data, no matter where they go. This marks a significant milestone in cybersecurity and data protection."
How can decentralised storage models prevent massive data breaches?,"How can decentralised storage models prevent massive data breaches?Is India’s biometric database a massive achievement or a dystopian nightmare? Can blockchain technology transform the security industry?All included in this week’s curated data digest below. 👇How can decentralised storage models prevent data breaches?The Equifax hack has been cited as very possibly the worst leak of personal info ever due to the “breath-taking amount of highly sensitive data it handed over to criminals”. As a consequence, “more than half of all US residents who rely the most on bank loans and credit cards” will be at a “significantly higher risk of fraud” for years to come.Writing for The Guardian, Jathan Sadowski provides an EXCELLENT overview of the “fundamental problem of the data economy as a whole: databanks like Equifax are too big”:As epic as Equifax’s hack was, things can get a lot worse. The credit reporting agencies Experian and TransUnion are data giants on par with Equifax and there are thousands of other data brokers that also possess large databanks. Data breaches like this one are not bugs, but rather features of a system that centralises immense amounts of valuable personal data in one place.Sadowski continues:The vaults of these databanks are impossible to secure, in large part, because the wealth of information they hold is a beacon for hackers. Even the most impenetrable cybersecurity will eventually fail under the pressure of dogged hackers probing for weaknesses to exploit. Better cybersecurity is important, but it is not a solution. It only postpones catastrophic failure.KEY TAKEAWAY — The future of data storage is decentralised models and the US needs to introduce stronger data protection laws — Equifax would have be fined 4% of global annual turnover under the GDPR. This is a breach no one should get away with.Is Aadhaar a massive achievement or a dystopian nightmare?Writing for VICE News, David Gilbert explores India’s controversial Aadhaar database which sought to give an identity to the 400 million people in India which “did not exist in the eyes of the government”. However:What is emerging is that [Aadhaar] is being used to create a panopticon, a centralised database that’s linked to every aspect of our lives — finances, travel, birth, deaths, marriage, education, employment, health, etc.Recently, the Indian government have also been granting private companies access to the system:Microsoft, for example, already taps into the database to confirm the identity of people using a version of Skype designed specifically for the Indian market. And Airbnb confirmed to VICE News that it is looking into Aadhaar as a potential option for verifying hosts.This move has been heavily criticised for increasing the government’s spying abilities and for letting “private companies profit off valuable personal information”.CRUCIALLY, Gilbert emphasises how Aadhaar will be hacked — it’s just a matter of time. The government insists the data centre is “robust and uncompromised”, but, similarly to Equifax, by “putting an entire country’s information in one place, they’ve made one massive target for hackers”.Side note — intriguing article by Ron Miller examining the “promise of managing identity on the blockchain”.Can blockchain technology transform the security industry?Charlie Osborne discusses how, if implemented correctly, decentralised technology can improve security solutions — as there is “no central holding system”:In an age when trust in systems is critical, we may yet see the blockchain integrated into systems which handle sensitive data and financial transactions, or control IoT and mobile devices.The technology may also provide a trustworthy infrastructure for vendors to better retain control of enterprise networks, who does what on them, and as a means to tackle weak spots in security protocols.MiscellaneousCognitive Logic has rebranded to InfoSum — check out our new site. 🙌Inside the store that only accepts personal data as currency. 💰How to spot visualisation lies. 📊London underground wifi tracking — neat report. 🚊Facebook AI learns human reactions after watching hours of Skype. 🤖DeepMind: Working towards a Verifiable Data Audit to build trust. 🏥Visualising halt times of passenger trains at stations in Mumbai (image above).✨Enjoy reading this?

Will Biometric Logins Replace Your Passwords?,"Will Biometric Logins Replace Your Passwords?53% of us forget crucial passwords more than once a week. Does this sound familiar to you?Bank notes and silver coins are starting to feel incredibly primitive or quaint at best to an increasing number of shoppers. Many are happier using their credit or debt card for both their online and offline purchases. Now that the U.S. has joined Europe and other nations by requiring a chip-in-card system, the pressure is on technology to increase security and at the same time replace other annoyances from our past such as PINs and the dreaded passwords.An estimated 53% of us forget crucial passwords more than once a week. Does this sound familiar to you? These forgetful episodes often involve us losing more than 10 minutes that we will never get back as we embark on the cumbersome reset of our account process. This often leads to shoppers abandoning their purchase through sheer frustration, while others miss out on buying concert tickets to a show that sells out in record time.With our login details written down on pieces of paper or notebooks, there is also a serious security issue that needs addressing. The road to progress involves improving the current process by making life simpler for consumers while also increasing security to prevent hacking or loss of personal data.I have been writing about the use of multiple biometric identification as a more secure method of authentication. Despite many thinking this technology would be nothing more than Hollywood fantasy, Apple’s latest smartphone changed that for the masses when it introduced both biometric identification and its Apple Pay system using tokenization. In an effort to keep credit cards from fading into history, MasterCard recently announced that they were beginning a phased launch of the first biometric corporate credit card program across Canada and the U.S.This technology will enable cardholders to verify transactions using facial recognition and fingerprint biometrics when making online purchases. The ethos of both Apple and MasterCard is that consumers shouldn’t have to sacrifice convenience for security. Each and every one of us is unique, so what could be more secure than enabling the person to become the password?The concepts of taking a selfie or scanning a fingerprint to authenticate our bank account is no longer an expensive or controversial idea. Amazon also hit the headlines recently after filing a patent that would enable its customers to pay by taking a selfie. Only 12 months ago, many would probably have scoffed at such a suggestion, but as I have pointed out in previous articles, the military has been using facial recognition for some time now with great success.A few weeks ago, mobile payments technology stole the show at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. Swiping or tapping our way through checkouts using wearables or even smart clothes seemed to promote the idea that nothing is impossible, and that there is no such thing as a bad idea.The Visa Token Service (VTS) offers a slightly different approach to the future of payments by replacing the 16-digit credit card number with a unique digital identifier that can be placed inside wearables, clothes, and appliances through the obligatory Visa Ready partners.When looking at the future of mobile payments, digital wallets often dominate conversations, but our future offers much more than smartphones with Touch ID. It has recently been estimated that one billion users will access banking services through biometric systems by 2017. If this prediction comes to fruition, we can expect an incredible level of growth in the biometrics industry.The success of this technology will largely depend on user adoption rates and if they are ready to embrace a digital world where they pay for items with a fingerprint and/or a selfie, as well as adding their voice and heartbeat pattern — to name a couple more proven biometrics — when additional security is needed. When MasterCard launched its first worldwide pilot of this technology in Holland, it discovered the overwhelmingly positive news that nine out of 10 participants reported they would like to replace their password with biometric identification.The pilot users interestingly highlighted how users preferred fingerprints and facial recognition authentication to the out-of-favor passwords. This suggests that adoption of this new way of authenticating will not be as difficult as some believe.Physical cash, PINs and passwords are all beginning to look a little dated. It shouldn’t be too much of a surprise to see multiple biometrics being embraced by both users and businesses. It appears that the biggest dilemma coming our way in the near future will be if we will use a smarter credit card or have all our cards in a smarter smartphone. What would you prefer?"
What Can You Do With Voice Biometrics?,"What Can You Do With Voice Biometrics?There are a number of companies that have or will soon be releasing new services for integration with voice biometric services. So what’s possible with voice biometrics?Registered user authentication. The ability to determine whether a given user is speaking and then unlock access. This is the case with “OK Google” or “Alexa” registered wake words. With this, users can allow their device to be unlocked only when they speak. Registering usually involves repeating the wake word a few times.User identification. This is when you try to identify a user against a previously acquired sample of that person’s voice. This ID can be pulled from a list of several individuals to potentially millions, in the case of government surveillance software.Characteristic identification. Can specific traits of an individual be extracted from a voice sample? Accent, gender, age, and even emotion might be characteristics that are extractable.In addition, these authentications can be done on the device and in real time or they can done off device and non-realtime. The embedded versions can also run “on-host”, like any other application, or “on-target”, as a low level, low power service.As the cost to license and implement these services come down, we can expect very interesting interactions to be built."
Introducing the very first Biometric Password Lockdown App,"Introducing the very first Biometric Password Lockdown AppThis application for your mobile device will change things in a huge way:Locks down smartphones with a finger-based biometric passwordMulti-factor authentication all-in-oneIt’s called BioTect-IDAnd why should you consider the world’s first biometric password for your mobile device? Because most smartphone security devices have been cracked by cyber thieves.Layers of protecting your online accounts have historically involved the password, a PIN, security questions or combinations of these which isn’t that secure. However getting into your devices requires even less — a single password, connecting dots with your finger or nothing at all. Some devices can be accessed with stronger security using your fingerprint or in some cases a combination of biometrics like face scan, voice or fingerprints.Now you may be convinced that a physical biometric, such as your fingerprint, palm pattern or face scan are so unique that they’re impossible to hack, but guess what: These are all hackable. In fact, a cyber crook could steal, for instance, your face or fingerprint image — for all time — and then what? You’re out of luck.So why have that possibility looming over you? Why not eliminate it with the BioTect-ID app? You have only one voice, one fingerprint, one palm, etc., but fingering in a hand written password means you can change the gesture biometric or the “drawing” of the password any time — because this is a behavior, not a static physical characteristic. Nobody can steal your gesture, not even your identical twin.BioTect-ID is also very privacy-conscious because there is nothing invasive about recording a gesture.The choice of which biometric to use becomes a very important consideration. The Internet of Things (IOS) will see our devices increase in value as they control our home access, record our health scores and process/retain many other aspects of our personal lives. The use of biometrics will increase dramatically to protect our privacy and security. But you want to choose carefully. Remember your unchanging physical body information will be hugely attractive to thieves who can steal your identity or use it for other purposes. But you can’t steal the BioTect-ID information.Here’s how the BioTect-ID multi-factor authentication works.With your mouse or finger, create a four-character password.BioTect-ID “learns” your unique finger/hand movements as you do this.To access your mobile phone, you “draw” your password into the BioTect-ID application.If you are the registered owner, you get access — with bad guys out of luck.BioTect-ID even solves the big problem of physical data being irreplaceable because it is a gesture biometric also known as a “dynamic” biometric, rather than something like a fingerprint or facial recognition.This is such exciting news from Biometric Signature ID that we just have to run through it again:The first biometric app that does not require invasive information about a body part like your eyes.The only privacy-conscious biometric security app in existence.Passwords cannot be stolen, not even borrowed, and of course, can’t be lost.Just draw your password with your finger, stylus or mouse, and this gesture will be captured.Only this gesture will unlock (and lock) your smartphone, and it takes only seconds.Easily reset your password at will.The strongest identity authentication on the planet.Don’t wait about getting this kind of protection, because biometrics is increasingly becoming a part of modern day life.The final frontier of privacy is your body, and by continuing to rely upon body-part biometrics, you keep that door open enough for a hacker to copy and, essentially, retain a part of your body. There goes your privacy, to say the least.The gesture-based, multi-factor authentication is poised to change the future of cyber protection. But not before this technology gets adequate awareness and support. We need to get this groundbreaking technology out there into the minds of Internet users.Here is how you’ll benefit with the BioTect-ID:Peace of mind, knowing that even the most brilliant hacker will never be able to duplicate or steal your gesture.Elimination of having to keep body-part details in filesKeeping your privacy and security safe from being exposed against your controlBeing the first to benefit from this cutting-edge security technologyYou can actually receive early edition copies of the app for reduced prices and get insider information if you become a backer on Kickstarter for a couple of bucks.

7 Trends in Biometric Technology as It Applies to FinTech,"7 Trends in Biometric Technology as It Applies to FinTechMitigating the risk of a security breach and protecting customer data is one of many concerns that need to be addressed with innovative technological solutions and methods. Biometric authentication is one such solution to this problem. With rapid innovation in this field, new companies and use cases are coming up in order to provide secure and convenient authentication processes to users.Governments and various industries are trying to implement mobile biometrics to speed up the process of biometric authentication. Individual biometric identification can be achieved on a mobile device either through its built-in biometric sensors or by attaching portable biometric hardware to it via a USB cable or through a Wi-Fi connection. The global biometric authentication and identification market is expected to undergo considerable growth over the next five years. The market size for biometrics is expected to reach $24.59 billion in the next six years, according to Grand View Research.Here are some of the major technology and market trends in this segment:Biometrics is expanding to the retail and consumer market to address problems with the current PIN and password authenticationMost commonly, current authentication methods don’t provide the security that is actually needed. Passwords can be hacked and socially engineered from personal information that is readily shared on social media. PINs are not unique; the 20 most common combinations represent over 25% of in-use four-digit passwords. Companies like Microsoft andIntel are implementing biometric authentication systems into their future products to protect user credentials. Biometric single sign-on (SSO) is a biometric password management technology that secures passwords & networks and protects data from unauthorized access & security breaches.Smartphone manufacturers are turning to biometrics to authenticate device accessThe number of global biometric smartphone users will rise to 471M in 2017, up from 43.23M last year. (Source:Biometrics Go Mobile: A Market Overview). According to Gartner, 30% of mobile devices will be using biometric authentication by 2016.Biometric modalities fueling the growth in consumer and retail are focused more on convenience than securityThere are different modes/methods of biometric authentication such as fingerprint, voice, retina, heartbeat, facial and others. Fingerprint biometrics, the least secure modality, is becoming mainstream with annual sensor shipments estimated at 1.4 billion units by 2020, up from 317 million in 2014. Bank of America recently introduced fingerprint and Touch ID sign-in for its mobile banking apps. With this feature, customers can use their fingerprints as a passcode for their mobile banking app. The main aim behind this new authentication facility is to provide its customers with secure and convenient banking. The new feature from banks will remove the need of text-based passcodes from users.Biometric authentication in paymentsBiometric solutions are being deployed for multiple payment use cases, including leveraging smartphones for POS purchases and using biometrics as a second form of authentication at ATMs. For example, Apple Pay is making mobile POS payments via smartphones much more secure by using fingerprinting in its Apple TouchID biometric system to verify a user’s identity and simplify the online and mobile process. Earlier, Touch ID was limited to the App Store, iTunes purchases and unlocking the device. The announcement caught the attention of banks and we witnessed Touch ID being used for accessing mobile banking services. Some of the banks who have already adopted Touch ID in their mobile banking apps are American Express, ING Bank, OutBank DE and Deutsche Bank.Biometrics for mobile bankingBiometric authentication seems to be an absolute must-have in the near future for banks, especially taking into consideration how mobile banking is getting popular. It seems to be a milestone when considering the future of mobile applications. If banks desire to remain competitive, they should anticipate customers’ expectations and needs. However, the key idea is to combine innovations with taking care of clients’ convenience and payments’ safety.Multifactor biometric authenticationOrganizations are now seriously considering multifactor biometrics like fingerprint, retina, voice, retina, facial and heartbeat for authentication as it has a lot of significance in online/mobile banking. Banks have started working with technology firms, developers and startups in order to create fool-proof authentication systems which will be the key to a great mobile banking and mobile payments experience. Wells Fargo is the first US-based financial institution to pilot a fusion of voice and face biometrics to authenticate customers, a feature that is being rolled-out to CEO Mobile’s iPhone app users in 2016. By identifying a customer’s face, voice and mobile device, biometric authentication makes it extremely difficult to spoof the true user.Industry-specialized biometric solutionsVarious kinds of solutions are designed to meet the unique demand of respective industries. The solutions are customized according to the local and international industrial laws and standards. For example, CertisID provides a specialized biometric solution for the financial services industry. It is designed to provide security and reduce fraud, providing a complete audit trail for both customer and employee activity. Another example is RightPatient, a company in the healthcare sector that facilitates a higher level of accuracy for patient identification, and unifies big data and clinical knowledge in healthcare in an unprecedented way to drive personalized health, decision support and predictive analytics.Originally published: 7 Trends in Biometric Technology as It Applies to FinTech"
