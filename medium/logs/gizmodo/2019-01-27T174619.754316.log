{'text': [u'A federal judge in California has ruled that law enforcement can\u2019t compel a suspect to unlock their phone with a fingerprint or face recognition. Combined with a previous ', u' that held police cannot force a suspect to tell them their password, we\u2019re getting some clarity on the future of search and seizure in the United States.', u'On Friday, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ', u' that requiring a suspect to unlock a device using their biometric data like face identification or an iris scan would be a violation of their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. \u201cIf a person cannot be compelled to provide a passcode because it is a testimonial communication, a person cannot be compelled to provide one\u2019s finger, thumb, iris, face, or other biometric feature to unlock that same device,\u201d Judge Kandis Westmore wrote in her ', u'.', u'The case Westmore was reviewing involved a request for a search warrant targeting property in Oakland. Police officers were investigating an extortion case involving two individuals suspected of using Facebook messenger to threaten a third-party with the leak of an embarrassing video if they did not pay a fee. Officers wanted to search a location where they believed the suspects were present and unlock the digital devices belonging to anyone discovered at the scene. Westmore denied the warrant.', u'Westmore deemed the warrant application to be \u201coverbroad\u201d because it identifies two suspects and also goes on to ask for authorization to force anyone found at the location to unlock their devices. Westmore found that officers had probable cause to search the premises but not to go rooting through the devices of anyone found on site while they were performing the search. The judge said that the application could be resubmitted only targeting the two suspects and any devices believed to belong to them. ', u'What was unexpected was Westmore\u2019s pronouncement that \u201ctechnology is outpacing the law,\u201d and, in the court\u2019s view, biometric data could be considered ', u'\u201ctestimonial communication\u201d protected by the Fifth Amendment. \u201cTestimony is not restricted to verbal or written communications,\u201d the judge wrote. Westmore pointed to case law that found producing documents in a way that testifies to their existence, the suspect\u2019s possession and control of them, and the documents\u2019 authenticity can all be considered testimonial. Obviously, unlocking your phone would likely check all of those boxes.', u'As obvious as that conclusion may seem, this is a remarkable interpretation of how biometric data can be viewed. Westmore concedes that biometric data like fingerprints and DNA swabs can be collected as evidence for further investigation. But if a suspect\u2019s fingerprint were used to unlock a device against their will, that fingerprint would amount to testimony given by the suspect that would potentially count as unconstitutional self-incrimination. Westmore makes it clear that the act of placing a fingerprint on a sensor to unlock a phone \u201cconcedes that the phone was in the possession and control of the suspect, and authenticates ownership or access to the phone and all of its digital contents.\u201d', u'Westmore\u2019s ruling conflicts with ', u', and it\u2019s hard to imagine that it won\u2019t be challenged. One reason to believe that the judge\u2019s take could hold up is that they cite a recent Supreme Court opinion from June in their reasoning. Westmore pointed to the ', u', which involved the collection of cellphone location data and quoted the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that courts should \u201cadopt rules that \u2018take account of more sophisticated systems that are already in use or in development.\u2019\u201d In other words: As long as the laws are behind the technology, the courts need to be taking the necessary mental leap to bring them up to date.', u'If Westmore\u2019s interpretation does withstand legal challenges, it could take a constitutional amendment to craft laws that would force users to unlock their own devices. Given the fact that lawmakers can\u2019t even agree to keep the government open, that\u2019s a tall hurdle to clear.', u'[', u' via ', u']', u'Staff Reporter\n'], 'title': [u"Cops Can't Force People to Unlock Their Phones With Biometrics, Court Rules"]}

{'text': [u'Apple does not typically do budget devices, but as they go, the iPhone XR comes pretty close. While hardly cheap (a budget phone should be under $400, not $750!), it represents a calculated attempt at creating a more affordable device that isn\u2019t a tremendous compromise. Something powerful enough that you can enjoy the perks of having the latest tech, without having to spend top dollar. And that\u2019s an extremely big deal, especially if spending $1000 on a phone feels like too much for you.', u"Apple's attempt at a big budget phone.", u'$750', u'The colors! The camera! The battery life!', u'The size! The display!', u'If you\u2019re trying to choose between the $750 XR and the', u', which start at $1,000 and $1,100 respectively, you\u2019ll find that there aren\u2019t too many differences on paper. They all use the same Face ID that we ', u' They all have a big notch and edge-to-edge displays. They\u2019re running on the same A12 processor (', u'). But the XR is much cheaper than the XS, and cutting the cost required quite a few compromises. The sides are aluminum instead of steel and it\u2019s rated to IP67 instead of IP68\u2014which means it\u2019s good for up to 30 minutes of immersion in 1 meter of water instead of 2 meters. It\u2019s also sized oddly, finding itself smack in middle between the XS and XS Max instead of being larger or smaller than both. Yet the biggest two differences are the display and the cameras. The XR uses a cheaper LCD display instead of the vibrant OLED found in the XS, and it has only one camera on the back instead of two.', u'Those are some notably major cost-cutting measures for a $750 phone. Consider that if you\u2019re willing to ditch Apple, there are some loaded phones for a lot less: OnePlus makes a', u' that includes dual rear cameras, an OLED display, and a current generation chipset!', u'But Apple has always done \u201cinexpensive\u201d devices differently than the rest. In some cases, cheaper devices mean older models, like the iPhone 7 or the MacBook Air, that just stay in circulation way past their prime. In others, they are new underpowered devices, like the iPhone SE or 5c, featuring appallingly outmoded hardware. In both cases, the compromises have been painful enough to make the devices at least somewhat unappealing. With the iPhone XR, Apple has gotten its take on an affordable device right.', u'The first thing you\u2019ll notice on', u' is the color. The XR is the first phone Apple\u2019s produced in a playful color palate in a while. Besides the traditional white and black, there\u2019s also a lovely red, coral, yellow, and blue. The colors are eye-catching, though the aluminum sides don\u2019t match the vibrant glass backs. Consequently, the phone can look a little cheap, especially next to the stainless steel sides on the XS. But if you\u2019re like me you\u2019ll find yourself shoving it into a case at the earliest opportunity to protect all that glass and easily scratchable aluminum. And that means your eyes will be immediately drawn to the display.', u'Just like the XS and Max, the XR has a notch, and as with those phones, it gives it a sense of ostentatious luxury. At a glance, this phone looks expensive. The True Depth camera embedded in the notch gives the phone the ability to use Face ID which is just a hair faster than the Face ID introduced in last year\u2019s iPhone X. If you\u2019ve been reluctant to upgrade because you prefer Touch ID, you\u2019ll need to come to terms with that on your own. Touch ID is gone. This phone, and likely all iPhones going forward, will rely on your face to unlock, and I for one am entirely okay with that. (You can use an old-fashioned passcode if you don\u2019t like your phone looking at you.)', u'I\u2019ve been using a 5.8-inch iPhone X for the last year and have never thought that display to be too small, but next to the XR it feels minuscule. The 6.1-inch display packed into the XR chassis splits the difference between the enormous 6.5-inch display in the Max and the 5.8-inch display in the XS and X. The 8 Plus\u2019s 5.5-inch display is also dwarfed by the XR\u2019s despite having a larger body overall. However you might feel about the notch, you\u2019ll find it difficult to look at an 8 Plus or older iPhone and not think they look positively lame next to the expansive display on the XR.', u'Now about that compromise. The XR display is not nearly as good as the display found in the XS or Max. Those devices use an OLED display with rich blacks and enviable contrast. The XR uses an LCD display, which can\u2019t get nearly as black\u2014so images look a little washed out in comparison and when watching content with black bars on the side, the notch sticks out', u'in a way it doesn\u2019t on iPhones with an OLED display.', u'Its 1792 x 828 resolution is much lower resolution than both the XS and last year\u2019s 8 Plus, but you probably won\u2019t notice that. What you will notice is the pixel density. The iPhone XR stoops to 326 ppi\u2014the same as the iPhone 8. The XS, by comparison, has a pixel density of 458ppi, while the iPhone 8 Plus has a density of 401ppi. What this means is that you can see the pixels of the', u'XR\u2019s LCD more easily than you might other phones. The pixels are evident if you\u2019re looking for them\u2014 you\u2019ll need a macro lens, magnifying glass or excellent close-range visual acuity, but they\u2019re there!', u'Surprisingly less obvious is the size of the damn thing. At 5.94 inches by 2.98 inches by .33 inches, the XR rests squarely between the XS (5.64 inches by 2.79 inches by 0.30 inches) and the XS Max (6.24 inches by 3.07 inches by 0.30 inches). It\u2019s smaller than the Max, as well as the identically-sized iPhone 8 Plus. Meanwhile, it\u2019s a little larger than the XS.', u'To get more specific, it\u2019s about a third of an inch taller than the XS, and a third of an inch shorter than the XS Max. It\u2019s also .19 inches wider than the XS, and 0.07 inches narrower than the Max. Those differences feel small, but they\u2019re surprisingly crucial for a lot of potential buyers. You\u2019ll absolutely notice the size if you\u2019re used to smaller phones like the XS, SE, or even the standard 8.', u'Personally, I was put off by the size of the XR immediately, but after a long weekend with the device, I\u2019ve found myself much less annoyed. Would I like a smaller budget phone that doesn\u2019t compromise speed or display quality? Absolutely! Do I find the XR unusable in my teeny tiny hands? Nope! As with the Max, Apple has included a feature, deep in the Accessibility settings, that lets you drag the top of the phone down towards the middle of the display so you can access the absolutely vital systems drop down. It takes a little getting used to, and you\u2019ll screw up activating it the first few times, but by the end of the weekend, I found myself to be something of a pro with the feature.', u'If size is a major consideration for you, I\u2019d encourage you to go into a store and hold the XR in your hand\u2014it\u2019s the only real way to know if it\u2019s too big for you and your back pocket.', u'The last time Apple made a serious attempt at a budget phone it was the iPhone SE\u2014a device with great hardware design but a processor at least a year older than the other phones made by Apple. This time around, Apple is not asking users to compromise speed for price, and the XR has the same zippy A12 processor as the XS and XS Max.', u'In day-to-day use app use, like web browsing and checking your email, you won\u2019t notice a difference between what it can do compared to the pricier phones or versus the A11 in last year\u2019s iPhones. One exception is battery life. The A12 has worked wonders on the battery life of the phones that contain it. We saw this with the XS, which lasted about an hour and ten minutes longer than the X in our tests, and we see it again with the XR which lasted quite a bit longer than the 8 Plus, despite the 8 Plus having a larger battery.', u'In our test, in which we set the brightness to 200 nits, turn off all radios except the wifi, and stream a video on YouTube until the phone powers down, the iPhone 8 Plus lasted a measly 9 hours and 10 minutes and the iPhone XR lasted an impressive 11 hours and 59 minutes. For comparison, the iPhone XS Max (3174 mAh) lasted 13 hours and 7 minutes, and the XS (2658 mAh) lasted 11 hours and 11 minutes.', u'The other noticeable change the A12 delivers is in camera performance. It lets the XR pull off tricks with a single lens that last year\u2019s iPhone 8 (the only single lens phone from Apple in 2017) could not. This processor actually lets the XR properly compete with the 8 Plus, a phone with twice the number of cameras on the back.', u'And yes, one of the most important things about phones these days is the camera. From messaging to social media, it\u2019s just so central to much of what we do with our phones.', u'The XR uses software and the A12 processor to, for the most part, deliver photo performance comparable to the 8 Plus. It has a wider lens (26mm versus 28mm) so it captures more of the world in a snap, but the images are sharp and vibrant (though, as with the XS, the Smart HDR feature can sometimes be too aggressive and result in smoothing effects ', u').', u'If you notice I keep comparing the XR to the 8 Plus and not the XS or XS Max\u2014that\u2019s because there\u2019s just a $50 price difference between the $700 8 Plus and the $750 XR. It feels like the more apt phone to draw comparisons to\u2014especially when we talk cameras. Because the XR actually uses the exact same wide-angle lens and sensor as the XS and XS Max. The only difference, camera-wise, between the XR and Apple\u2019s flagship phones is it lacks a telephoto lens.', u'So when I went on a long walk through Red Hook over the weekend, I left the XS and Max at home and carried just the XR and 8 Plus. I found myself not actually missing the telephoto lens (a 56mm equivalent) I from the XS. Sure it would have been more handy for snapping a shot of a sign well out of reach, but when taking pictures of a flower, my attempts at a macro shot with the XR were sharper and clearer than the 8 Plus despite the 40 miles-per-hour wind whipping my hand and the flowers all around.', u'The XR also caught more details of the waves in this shot of the Upper Bay. And note the clouds\u2014where you can again see more details thanks to the superior dynamic range of the XR. It simply caught more of the real world in a photo and translated it to the display.', u'The improved dynamic range helped in this photo of a street sign at night too. The red hand in the photo below is just a big orange blob when shot with the 8 Plus, but you can see each individual bulb with the XR.', u'But while the camera quality is impressive, there is one major shortcoming\u2014the XR has the full Portrait Mode on the front cameras, but not on the back. Portrait Mode allows the phone\u2019s cameras to mimic the creamy bokeh found in larger standalone cameras giving you a nice blurry background that better highlights your subject. On smartphones, this typically requires two cameras placed by one another. Any iPhone with Face ID can do it on the front\u2014making for attractive selfies. As two cameras are required phones like the 7 and 8 have been unable to do it. Only the 7 Plus, 8 Plus, X, XS, and XS Max could accomplish portrait photos with their dual rear cameras.', u'But despite having a single rear camera the XR uses software and the sheer number-crunching power of the A12 processor to accomplish a similar effect, with two big caveats. One is that it will only do three of the portrait lighting modes: Natural, Studio, and Contour. The Stage Light and Stage Light Mono modes won\u2019t work\u2014which means no all black background for portraits shot with the rear camera. But the second caveat has the potential to be the bigger one\u2014the rear Portrait Mode only works with human faces. Teddy Ruxpin, Funko dolls, and my roommate\u2019s cat do not count. A pop up will appear noting a human face needs to be in the frame for Portrait Mode to work.', u'At first, this felt like it could be a deal breaker, but I\u2019ve always found using Portrait Mode with the rear camera to be a challenge. You have to have just the right amount of light and distance so snapping a quick pic of your cat is usually out of the question. Not having the pressure of pulling off a clutch portrait snap is kind of nice\u2014even if I miss the flexibility it allows.', u'As we\u2019ve said numerous times in this review, compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is full of compromises. If you want a brand new cutting-edge iPhone for under $1,000 you\u2019ll have to sacrifice some of your rear portrait shots. And you\u2019ll have to sacrifice the prettier display. Yet at this point, for most people, I think the sacrifices are acceptable. If you are a nerdy gadget lover, these are limitations that will seem disappointing. I assure you that in practice they are not.', u'The iPhone XR is really good, just as the XS, XS Max, X, 8, 8 Plus, and even the 7 and 7 Plus are. The improvements we\u2019re seeing year to year are nice, but they\u2019re rarely the kind of improvements that would motivate a person to go drop $750 or more on a phone.', u'In that respect, the iPhone XR isn\u2019t a required upgrade to people owning the 8 or 8 Plus. It isn\u2019t even required if you own the 7 or 7 Plus. But the upgrades are very, very good, and you\u2019ll find yourself smiling as you appreciate the photos it takes, or as you relish the fact your phone can last through not just a cross-country flight, but the awful delays on both ends of the flight too.', u'The XR is good enough that I don\u2019t miss the XS.

So what\u2019s the deal with it?', u'I picked up an iPhone X review unit yesterday afternoon from Apple, and the first thing I did\u2014the first thing I needed to do\u2014was test out the much ballyhooed Face ID (a more complete review will happen once I\u2019ve actually had a few days with the damn thing). The better camera and the gorgeous display are definitely crucial features, but no component of the iPhone X is more critical to its long-term success than Face ID. This is Apple\u2019s next big stab at biometric security, and if the company flubs it up, if a cheap sensor in the Home button is a better solution than a delicate sensor array in the display, then Apple\u2019s has built nothing more than a really nice ', u'.', u'When the iPhone X eventually arrives in November it will come loaded with a futuristic camera\u2026', u'And that can\u2019t happen. Apple\u2019s strength isn\u2019t in bleeding edge hardware, it\u2019s in the most friendly user interface and experience available in a phone today. The new Face ID module should allow you to just glance at your phone and swipe to access your home screen. But is that easier than a fingerprint sensor really?', u'I should note that Face ID is also supposed to make the phone more secure. Touch ID is definitely neat, but has always been', u'. Nasir Memon, chair of the New York University Tandon School of Engineering explained to ', u'\xa0 that Touch ID actually takes multiple tiny photos of a person\u2019s fingerprints. \u201cWhat it\u2019s doing is capturing small, small squares\u2014little partial fingerprints,\u201d he said. ', u'According to Apple, that means there\u2019s a one in 50,000 chance that a stranger can access a phone via Touch ID. With Face ID, Apple claims that number  jumps to one in a million. (Though Apple says the number falls significantly if you have an identical twin or other relative with remarkably similar features).', u'But it needs to see your entire face to work, and as we approach winter, you start to see some of the shortcomings inherent in the new technology. Both Touch ID and Face ID require you to remove your gloves, but, as I noted in a test this afternoon, Face ID also demands you lose the scarf over your nose or the hat pulled down past your eyebrows. In fact, for all of Apple\u2019s bluster, in some situations, Face ID starts to feel less convenient. I can\u2019t blindly unlock my phone while it\u2019s still in my pocket, and because you have to swipe up to unlock the phone, it feels like there\u2019s an extra step sometimes when I unlock the iPhone X.', u'In regular practice, Face ID actually works almost perfectly much of the time. I don\u2019t even think about it. I tilt the phone towards my face and swipe. No patient holding of a button. The little lock at the top of the display simply switches over, and I\u2019m in. To my amusement, it even unlocks if I make a funny face, and I\u2019ve got to admit, having my phone unlock while I\u2019m doing a monkey face is a delight.', u'Best yet, it works totally well even in situations when you would expect a facial recognition system to definitely fail. Trying to open my phone  in pitch black room or after whipping my glasses off my face? No problem!', u'Glasses are an important thing to discuss, though. I\u2019ve only had the iPhone X a few hours, and it\u2019s taken that long for the Face ID module to understand the big planes of plastic in front of my face. After the initial setup of Face ID, in which you rotate your face slowly while staring at the camera, the technology takes time to learn your features, becoming smarter the longer you use it. That means the first time you try to open your phone in a dark room, or while wearing glasses, it might fail. But after you\u2019ve done it a few dozen times, it knows your every contour and crevice, and, according to Apple, it might even work when you have a monster beard or forget to Nair the mustache your hirsute genetics gave you.', u'But this was only at the beginning of my week with this phone.

But that\u2019s not all, because this year, Apple\u2019s flagship has a super-sized sibling in the new iPhone Xs Max.', u'As before, the smaller iPhone Xs features a 5.8-inch screen, while the new Xs Max gets a monstrous 6.5-inch screen that\u2019s even bigger than what you get on a ', u', with both sporting OLED display tech for extra rich colors in pictures and videos. But for those afraid of what sounds like a monstrous device, fear not, because thanks to much slimmer bezels, the iPhone Xs Max is actually about the same size as last year\u2019s iPhone 8 Plus. ', u'Additionally, Apple says its OLED screens are now even brighter and sport 120Hz touch-sensitivity\xa0and HDR support for enhanced viewing and smoothness, and for all you 3D Touch fans out there, both the Xs and Xs Max have that too. But a good viewing experience isn\u2019t all about the screen\u2014sound matters too. So Apple has given both phones new speakers with what Apple is calling wide stereo sound as well.', u'Of course, one of the iPhone X\u2019s most loved and hated features has returned as well, with both the Xs and Xs Max getting Face ID notches up top. Powered by Apple\u2019s TrueDepth camera system, crammed inside that little notch is an ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, flood illuminator, infrared camera, and a 3D dot projector that can scan your face to make sure that you\u2014and hopefully only you\u2014can unlock your device. Apple says it has even upgraded the iPhone\u2019s algorithms and secure enclave so that Face ID recognizes you faster.', u'Like clockwork, inside both the Xs and Xs Max, Apple has once again made a new chip called the A12 Bionic to help boost general performance and AI-related processing. Apple claims the A12 Bionic is the industry\u2019s first 7 nanometer chip, though ', u'. It\u2019s got a 4-core CPU and a 6-core GPU totaling 6.9 billion transistors, with a mixture of high and low-performance cores in order to more efficiently handle various workloads with energy efficiency gains of up to 40 or 50 percent. ', u'And when it comes to the \u201cBionic\u201d part of the A12, Apple says the real star of the chip should be its neural engine which is comprised of eight cores dedicated to AI and machine learning duties. Elsewhere, other parts of Apple\u2019s SoC boast improved ISPs, video processing, memory controllers and more, which should result in more fluid operation, something that has been one of the iPhone\u2019s biggest selling points over the years. ', u'And for those who need a ton of room to store photos, videos, apps and anything else, max storage on the iPhone has doubled from 256GB to 512GB. Apple is even saying that with the new A12 Bionic and some of the performance upgrades in iOS 12, launching apps on a new iPhone Xs or Xs max should happen 30 percent faster. ', u'For all your picture taking needs, Apple has redesigned the iPhone Xs\u2019 camera with new dual 12-MP sensors: one for wide-angle shots, and one for telephoto. Inside, the sensor itself sports larger 1.4 micron pixels, with the wide angle lens getting an aperture of f/1.8. Unfortunately, the zoom on the telephoto lens has remained pat at 2X, though at least both cameras will come with optical image stabilization. ', u'And when you want to shoot things with portrait mode or special depth effects, both cameras can work together to add extra dimension to your shots. ', u'Behind the scenes, the Apple\u2019s image signal processor is also working harder to improve your pics by more accurately setting white balance, focus, reducing noise, preserving highlights and more, then combining all those adjustments into a single high-quality composite. ', u'And for 2018, Apple\u2019s new Smart HDR feature will now shoot a four-shot burst to make sure you don\u2019t miss a moment, while additional interframes and long-exposures are snapped to help capture as much detail as possible. Even the iPhone Xs\u2019 bokeh (the blurry out of focus part of a photo) has been improved to better mimic a big DSLR or mirrorless camera, and if you\u2019re still not satisfied with that, you will even be able to adjust a picture\u2019s depth of field after the shot has been taken.', u'So how \u2018bout that battery life? For the iPhone Xs, Apple says it will last just 30 minutes longer than last year\u2019s iPhone X. That\u2019s not exactly a huge increase, which is preciesly where the iPhone Xs Max comes in. Featuring the biggest battery Apple has ever put in an iPhone, the iPhone Xs Max should result in an extra hour and 30 minutes of runtime over an iPhone X.', u'And as a bonus for frequent travelers, both the iPhone Xs and Xs Max will come with space for dual SIMs, so you can switch off between multiple phone numbers and data plans on the fly. Though depending on where you buy your phone, you\u2019ll either have the choice of one SIM card plus an eSIM, or two physical SIM cards for phones sold in China and elsewhere. ', u'Both the iPhone Xs and Xs Max will be available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB storage sizes, with the smaller Xs starting at $1,000, and the larger Xs Max starting at $1,100. They will be available for pre-order on Friday, September 14, with shipments going out a week later on September 21st. ', u"Senior reporter at Gizmodo, formerly Tom's Guide and Laptop Mag.

{'text': [u'It sucks when a new technology comes along and creeps everybody out. It sucks even more when that technology is so good, so life-changing that even the most  discerning consumer sets that anxiety aside and says, \u201c', u'\u201d That\u2019s what Face ID has done to me with the iPhone X. And if you\u2019re not already using it, you\u2019re next.', u'To no one\u2019s surprise, Apple might be adding Face ID to more of its mobile products. The face-enabled iPad rumor  has been floating around for months, but  it got a big jolt of legitimacy on Thursday, when, ', u', developers found clues about a new iPad in the recently released iOS 11.3 beta. The code refers to something called the \u201cmodern iPad,\u201d which is significant because some of the clues about the iPhone X came from references to a \u201cmodern iPhone\u201d in older firmware releases. The modern iPad, the supposition goes, will feature Face ID.', u'There\u2019s plenty of chatter to back up that bet, too. Bloomberg ', u' a couple of months ago that the company will release a new iPad with Face ID capabilities later this year. Trusted Apple rumor mongers Mark Gurman and Alex Webb say that the new tablet will likely be about 10.5-inches, like the current iPad Pro, feature a slimmer bezel, and have no Home button. As with the iPhone X before it, the new iPad will depend on Face ID for unlocking and other security-related tasks. This rumor backed up ', u' from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who told investors that an iPad with a TrueDepth sensor was imminent last October.', u'This almost feels like deja vu. Apple brought Touch ID to the iPad 2 roughly a year after debuting the technology on the iPhone 5S back in 2013. Understanding that timeline makes the release of a Face ID-enabled iPad about a year after the technology first appeared on the iPhone X seem almost indisputable. It would honestly be more surprising if Apple ', u' start slapping Face ID on more of its devices so quickly. After all, Jony Ive revealed last year that his team had been working on the technology for five years  before Face ID\u2019s initial release. God knows how much money Apple spent getting it right.', u'Apple got it right, too. I can confidently say that Face ID is the best biometric security technology I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019d also argue that it\u2019s the best on the market. Two months after getting my iPhone X, I\u2019ve practically forgotten what it\u2019s like to hold my thumb over a sensor or to type in a passcode to unlock my phone. Face ID is so fast and dependable, my phone is almost always ready to use when I glance at it. I could almost forget that this is because Apple is identifying and cross-checking the most minute details of my face every time I use it. If I thought facial recognition was creepy six months ago, I think it\u2019s incredible now. Face ID works so well, I stopped thinking about the privacy implications last Thanksgiving.', u'Which brings me back to my original point. If you have avoided Face ID because you don\u2019t like Apple scanning your face all the time, that\u2019s cool. But if you\u2019re an Apple loyalist, you probably need to get over it. That, or Apple is going to make your life even more difficult. ', u' on mobile devices in the near future, but we can also expect it to take over the MacBook lineup as well. Just as the latest MacBook Pros got a Touch ID sensor, the MacBooks of the future will probably have TrueDepth cameras, and users will be coerced into using Face ID to unlock everything, sort of like how ', u'\u2014which also unlocks laptops with a look. No more passwords. No more thumbprints. Just your dumb face staring a screen that\u2019s blasting infrared light into your wrinkles and verifying your identity. It\u2019s a Philip K. Dick plot playing out in real life, and I don\u2019t even care this time.', u'If you\u2019re not an Apple person, you\u2019re probably laughing at this point. You might be content pattern-unlocking your phone until the next century. Even still, companies like Samsung ', u' in biometric security, too. The Galaxy S8 features an iris scanner that doesn\u2019t work as well as Face ID in my experience yet also bears some dystopian implications. And while all of these companies claim that their technology is the most secure ever, it only takes one big hack to make everyone step back and ponder the state of technological progress for at least one product cycle.', u'Me, I\u2019m never going back. If there\u2019s a database full of biometric data somewhere my face is in it, and I\u2019m already spoiled on the quick convenience of looking at a device to unlock it. I welcome Apple\u2019s efforts to install facial recognition cameras on all of its computer gadgets. Face ID is unstoppable, just like Touch ID before it. You can turn it off, and you can put tape over the sensor. But as far as Apple products are concerned, your face is your password from here on out.

{'text': [u'When you look at the design of Apple, Samsung, and Google\u2019s latest phones, there\u2019s very little to distinguish this year\u2019s crop from 2017\u2019s has-beens. Meanwhile, outside of the big three, every other phone maker seemed content to jump on the notched screen bandwagon and settle for similarly iterative aesthetics. And just when it seemed like 2018 was going to be a truly boring year for phones, Oppo went and made the Find X, a device that simultaneously shows smartphone creativity isn\u2019t dead and buries the idea that there\u2019s no way to avoid those stupid screen cutouts.', u'A gorgeous all-screen phone', u'Starts at around $925', u'Slick design, no notch, neat popup camera, surprisingly good battery life', u'Photo quality is just OK, too much bloatware, no water-resistance or wireless charging, questionable durability, not available in the U.S.', u'From top to bottom, the Find X is a vision of elegant simplicity. Its tapered glass sides look and feel great, while the thin black outline that runs along the outside of the display highlights all that unblemished screen real estate like a nice frame on an even better painting. Even on the back, Oppo strives for subtle sophistication with subdued pops of color hidden beneath smokey glass. The only indication of the Find X\u2019s deeper nerd appeal is a slim, crescent-shaped sliver of plastic where the camera would normally be.', u'All these things work together to ensure that there\u2019s nothing to distract you from the Find X\u2019s screen, which is exactly what you want. Featuring a vivid AMOLED panel with a 2340 x 1080 resolution spread across 6.42-inches, the Find X offers one of the most immersive viewing experiences on smartphone yet. The only minor quibble, and I do mean minor, is that the Find X\u2019s peak brightness of 425 nits is 20 to 30 percent dimmer than what you\u2019d get on a new Samsung Galaxy or iPhone. When indoors or in the shade, this isn\u2019t an issue, but if you spend a lot of time staring at your phone outside, it\u2019s not ideal.', u'To get the real fireworks going, all you need to do is unlock the phone or open the camera app to make the Find X\u2019s motorized camera pop open like the secret entrance to a Bond villain\u2019s hideout. Not only does the hidden camera fulfill its traditional picture-taking duties, because the Find X doesn\u2019t have an onboard fingerprint sensor, it also functions as a face scanner so you don\u2019t have to enter your pin 50 times a day.', u'Now some folks might get annoyed at the half second or so it takes the Find X\u2019s cam to rise up from its hidey hole. But between the wonderfully techy noise of the tiny motor whirring about inside that sounds like the powered CD trays from desktops of yesteryear and the sheer majesty of watching the phone transform on command, every time I needed to use its cameras, the Find X put a smile on my face. Sometimes, it truly is the small things that make you happy.', u'Unfortunately, even with all this geeky goodness, a respectable battery life just shy of 12 hours and specs that include a Snapdragon 845, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (along with an upcoming model with a ', u'), the Find X\u2019s still has a number of flaws. It\u2019s not officially sold in the U.S., so depending on where you get one, the phone may not have important stuff like the Google Play Store pre-installed, which means you\u2019ll need to sideload the APK file yourself.', u'Oppo\u2019s Color OS is also a bit behind the times since it\u2019s based on Android 8.1 rather than Android 9. But the more frustrating part is that phone comes with an entire folder full of bloatware, and by default, its notifications aren\u2019t set to show anything useful, so you need to go and customize your preferences for each app one by one. Also, for the $925 or so you\u2019ll need to fork over to a third-party reseller just to buy one, the Find X\u2019s lack of wireless charging, microSD card slot and any sort of water resistance are glaring omissions.', u'And remember what I said earlier about the screen sometimes being hard to see outdoors? Well, the Find X\u2019s issues go even further than that because I feel like for people that are even moderately adventurous, this phone is probably a hard pass. Not only have multiple people demonstrated that the Find X\u2019s chassis is ', u' than your typical handset, it\u2019s also not very smart, because if you accidentally try to unlock the while it\u2019s in your pocket, the motorized camera will pop out and struggle in frustration for a few seconds before giving up.', u'When the camera is open, you can also lightly shake the phone and hear the pop up slider rattle a bit in its housing. And even though there are cases that work with the Find X, I\u2019d be dubious about any of them being able to provide sufficient protection in the event that the phone gets dropped on its camera. All these things exactly don\u2019t bode well for the Find X\u2019s long-term durability, so here\u2019s hoping they can be refined and improved on future iterations.', u'The image quality from Find X\u2019s cameras are also just OK. The phone never had any trouble recognizing my face when unlocking the phone, but despite offering a whopping 25-MP cam in front and 16-MP and 20-MP cams in back, overall image quality definitely falls short of other devices in this price range.', u'In a head-to-head photo shootout against a Galaxy Note 9 and S9+, the Find X was always a couple steps behind. And while I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call the Find X\u2019s pictures disappointing, they just consistently lacked that extra level of sharpness and color saturation from pics produced by its competitors.', u'But even with all this, I want to be clear: Flaws and all, the Find X is a captivating device. Oppo could have played it safe and churned out something that may have been more practical or affordable, but it didn\u2019t. Instead, Oppo took a chance, and in a year when people waged countless internet battles over notches versus bezels, the Find X did its own thing. It delivered the all-screen dream. Now, Oppo has something innovative and unique to build upon. And even when you consider that Samsung could debut a bendable screen phone before the end of the year, there\u2019s no question the Oppo Find is one of the most important smartphones of the year.', u'Color OS running Android 8.1 \u2022 Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 \u2022 8GB of RAM \u2022 128GB of storage \u2022 6.42-inch 2340 x 1080 AMOLED display \u2022 25-MP front-facing pop up cam \u2022 16-MP rear cam \u2022 20-MP secondary cam with 2x zoom \u2022 USB-C \u2022 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac wi-fi \u2022 Bluetooth 5.0 \u2022 3,730 mAh battery \u2022 6.17 x 2.92 x 037 inches \u2022 6.56 ounces \u2022 GSM only', u"Senior reporter at Gizmodo, formerly Tom's Guide and Laptop Mag.

The iPhone 8, however, is selling better than expected. Maybe people like the Home button!', u'This must be an awful surprise for Apple\u2019s accountants. Based on the company\u2019s marketing strategy, the new Face ID-enabled iPhones were destined for success. Yes, there were early murmurs about bad iPhone X sales, but Apple CEO Tim Cook ', u', announcing that the first iPhone without a Home button was the company\u2019s best-selling model for every week that it was available. This was also Apple\u2019s first $1,000 iPhone, leaving many to wonder if the four-figure sum might be asking too much of consumers at a time when most cheaper smartphones do all the things you\u2019d want a smartphone to do.', u'Then, along came the iPhone XR. With that big, pretty screen, it looks a lot like the pricier iPhone X, and at $750, it costs a lot less. It also lacks the Home button and Touch ID security from earlier iPhone models. But why would anyone want those old things now that Apple lets you unlock your phone with your face?', u'Hard to say. If Nikkei\u2019s sources are correct, there are presumably many thousands of people who would like to keep the old Home button and a slightly smaller screen. Those sources report that Foxconn is producing up to 100,000 fewer iPhone XR units per day than Apple had initially planned\u2014\u201cdown 20% to 25% from the original optimistic outlook.\u201d Meanwhile, Apple has increased orders for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus by 5 million units. Nikkei was not shy about why this might be the case:', u'The moves to add orders for year-old iPhone models while suspending extra production for the latest product illustrates Apple\u2019s lack of innovation and inability to energize consumers with such a pricing strategy. ', u'So it seems like the new iPhone X series might not be as jazzy as Apple had hoped. But maybe it\u2019s not so much that the new big-screened, Face ID-enabled devices aren\u2019t exciting. Maybe people really do just love the Home button. The iPhone XR doesn\u2019t have one. The iPhone 8 does. It\u2019s got haptic feedback, too. Tap it, and you really feel like you\u2019re doing something. You definitely don\u2019t feel like Apple has built an incredibly sophisticated camera that will scan your face even at impossible angles and unlock your bank account. The Home button is more simple than that.', u'Then again, maybe these numbers are completely unrelated to an iPhone\u2019s features. It\u2019s hard to say what people like or hate based solely upon sales numbers. It\u2019s equally difficult to determine whether gadgets live or die based upon slightly different features. It might just be the price. An iPhone 8 costs $600, and an iPhone 8 Plus is $700. They\u2019re both cheaper than the iPhone XR, and for those that care, they have a feature that the iPhone XR lacks: a Home button!', u'This is all, inevitably, another signal that buying an iPhone ', u'. Apple wants you to spend $1,000 on a device, but it\u2019s also giving you more options than ever before to avoid doing so. Turns out this company is really good at selling stuff and making money.

{'text': [u'There\u2019s just something about this phone. From the moment I laid eyes on this thing, it just kind of made me happy. It\u2019s small and adorable like a newborn puppy, and despite how petite it appears it photos, it looks and feels even smaller in person. And I\u2019m not the only one that had this reaction. When I brought it into the office, people crowded around marveled. One person cooed at it, another said, \u201cit\u2019s perfect,\u201d while a third remarked that this is the exact sort of thing they\u2019d wished someone would make for years.', u'A super small phone from the rebirthed Palm brand', u'$350 (plus $10 a month for data)', u"It's incredibly tiny, but still good enough to be a full standalone phone", u"Camera quality isn't great and it can't detect 5GHz wi-fi; it's billed as a companion device, and as such, its sales and pricing scheme is messy ", u'From a crowd of tech bloggers, even I was taken aback with its reception. Size alone isn\u2019t what makes this handset remarkable. In part what makes the device exciting is that it\u2019s the rebirth of Palm, the same company that made big \u2018ole PDAs and the ', u'. Maybe more interestingly, Palm\u2019s new phone also envisions an entirely different way of using and living with tech.', u'For something so small, it\u2019s pretty mysterious, and I\u2019m actually not even entirely sure what to call it. The company that makes it is Palm, but what about the device itself? Is it just Phone with a capital P, or is it the Palm Palm as its ', u' suggests? For now, I\u2019ve been going with Baby Phone or the just the mononymous Palm, because like Grimes, Wario, and Rasputin, this gadget is cool enough to need only a single name.', u'Now let\u2019s talk about size. I don\u2019t mean its actual dimensions\u2014which are about the same as a credit card\u2014but the reason behind why it\u2019s so tiny. Recently, a lot of companies have been pushing the idea of digital wellness, with ', u' and ', u'adding features to Android and iOS that help you track how much time you spend on your phone. That\u2019s all fine, but in some ways, buying an $800 phone and then putting restrictions on it is like buying an Aston Martin and never driving it faster than 55 mph.', u'So instead of spending a lot of money on a phone that constantly tempts you, why not get something small and nimble that can still handle traditional smartphone duties, but doesn\u2019t also ruin your life. That\u2019s the real inspiration behind the Palm\u2019s pint-sized body and mini display. You\u2019re supposed to pull it out, check the screen real quick, and then put it away.', u'The Palm is a more straightforward way to fight smartphone addiction, and while it does quite well at replacing your regular phone, it has some quirks and a few sore spots you should know about. I\u2019m going to break things down ', u' style.', u'First comes the good stuff. Unlike a dumb feature phone or other gadgets that attempt to fight Internet-driven FOMO, the Palm runs a full mobile OS (Android 8) with a custom home screen/app launcher designed to be easy to use on a tiny display. That means it supports all your favorite apps, and launching them is as simple as scrolling through a relatively compact grid of app icons and tapping on the one you want.', u'Sure, things like text and quick settings icons look small, and if you\u2019re someone who thinks about bifocals a lot, this may not be the device for you. But for everyone else, screen readability and UI navigation aren\u2019t actually that bad. There\u2019s even an old-school capacitive touch button below the screen that can be tapped once to go back, tapped twice to go home, or long-pressed to open up all your recent apps.', u'On top of that, the Palm was designed to be used hands-free, by leveraging voice controls and the Google Assistant to do things like reply to texts or search for directions. If you feel weird about talking out loud to your devices, using the baby phone like this does take some getting used to, but it works.', u'The phone even has a simple 2D face unlock system, so you don\u2019t need to hit tiny number buttons every time you want to unlock your phone. And instead of squeezing the sides of the phone or long-pressing its home button, you can summon the Google Assistant just by holding down the power button, which is the phone\u2019s lone physical control.', u'Then there\u2019s the baby phone\u2019s build, which feels surprisingly solid. I really can\u2019t help but admire how nice it is for a phone this small, especially since it can be stowed away almost anywhere. It utterly disappears into pockets, and you shouldn\u2019t run into any issues sliding it into even the smallest of clutches. You can even stash it in your jeans\u2019 coin pocket, or jam it down your sock if you\u2019re so inclined. So, of course, it also feels puny in your hands like no other smartphone does.', u'The baby phone\u2019s screen is also exceedingly bright, hitting 808 nits on our light meter, which is higher than any phone I\u2019ve tested in the last 18 months. And despite weighing barely more than two ounces, it still offers an IP68 rating, so it\u2019ll survive a quick dip in water.', u'Now onto the bad. Like most new smartphones, the baby phone doesn\u2019t have a headphone jack or microSD card storage. However, due to its diminutive size, the excuse about not having enough room inside actually holds up. Same goes for the Palm\u2019s lack of wireless charging, though, it would be kind of neat if the baby phone were a truly wire-free device.', u'As for its camera, the Palm sports a 12-MP cam in the back and an 8-MP selfie cam up front. In bright light, these cameras are serviceable, though as you\u2019d expect, the Palm\u2019s pics don\u2019t quite deliver the quality of what you\u2019d get from a Pixel 3. Then again, with a retail price of $350, I\u2019m not that bothered. But when things get dark, the Palm\u2019s cameras struggle quite a bit more.', u'Finally, while I wouldn\u2019t exactly call the Palm\u2019s performance or battery life bad, it fits best in this section. Browsing around between apps is usually quite snappy, but equipped with just a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 chipset, it\u2019s sort of ridiculous to ask for more. That said, you can still play things like ', u' or ', u' just fine, but in absolute numbers, the baby phone\u2019s benchmarks are some of the lowest I\u2019ve seen in a while.', u'As for battery life, on our rundown test, it lasted a laughable three hours and six minutes, which is a quarter of what you get on a lot of flagship devices. But our test is performed by streaming video continuously over wifi, which goes against the entire idea of the phone, so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that those numbers look bad. And if you play even the most casual of games like a match-three puzzler, you can crush the baby phone\u2019s battery in 90 minutes or less.', u'But if you actually try to embrace Palm\u2019s internet-addiction fighting ways by just checking your phone a couple of times an hour, streaming music a little bit, and limiting it to other practical purposes, it\u2019s quite possible for its battery to last all day. Instead of being a true con, the Palm\u2019s battery life is almost a pro, because it punishes you for sliding back into abusive habits. Palm\u2019s baby phone can help you improve your digital wellbeing, but only if you let it.', u'For those still concerned about longevity, Plam even equipped its device with something called Life Mode, which helps preserve battery life while also cutting down on distractions. In this mode, when you lock your screen, the phone goes into a super Do Not Disturb of sorts. And as long as your screen stays dark, you won\u2019t get any calls, texts or notifications. Then, when you want to check in on the world, you can unlock your phone and get a quick recap to fill you in.', u'All told, the negatives above aren\u2019t that bad, but just when you thought it was safe, comes Palm\u2019s ugly side. The first nasty omission is that the Palm only sports 802.11 a/b/g/n wifi, which means that the phone can\u2019t see any 5GHz 802.11 ac networks.', u'But the Palm\u2019s second and biggest deal-breaker for many is that the Palm is a Verizon exclusive, which leaves ', u'. And while the phone is technically an unlocked device, the pinhole for the Palm\u2019s SIM tray is so small it\u2019s damn near impossible to remove, and there\u2019s a good chance you might damage the tray if you try to force it. And as if to discourage any additional attempts to remove the SIM tray, the Palm doesn\u2019t come bundled with its own ejector like most phones nowadays. And even if you do manage to crack open that SIM tray, the baby phone is missing a number of LTE bands that would allow it to work fully on other networks.', u'To make matters worse, because this phone is billed as a companion device, Verizon won\u2019t sell you a baby phone unless you already have a primary device (even though the Palm works just fine on its own and doesn\u2019t actually need a second device to connect to cell service or wi-fi). And if that wasn\u2019t enough, on top of the Palm\u2019s $350 price tag, you\u2019ll also need to fork over $10 a month for data and the luxury of using Verizon\u2019s Number Share service, which allows you to use the same phone number across multiple devices instead of having to juggle a second set of digits. Number Share also lets the Palm sync texts with your primary phone, so you don\u2019t miss any messages, but only if you use Verizon\u2019s texting app.', u'Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I can totally see the appeal this thing being used to compliment a larger and more powerful handset. You have one phone for work and business, and the Palm for everything else. Going out for a fancy dinner and don\u2019t want to be loaded down with tech? The baby phone is an easy choice. Or how about going for a run? The Palm is a better option for making sure you are reachable and for streaming music than many wearables, even the ones with built-in LTE.', u'But not allowing the Palm to operate as a standalone phone is a tragedy. It would be a great handset for kids, and its battery life might mean teens would actually stay off their phone for fear of running out of juice. And what about all the people that just want a phone that\u2019s small, cute, and simple. Forcing people to buy two phones when all they really want is one seems incredibly dumb.', u'The Palm is one of the best examples yet of how you can stay connected without letting it drive you crazy. It can go practically anywhere, and it has just enough to make sure you don\u2019t feel deprived. At first, I thought this tiny little phone was a snack. But you know what, that\u2019s not quite right. It\u2019s more like a full meal in a bite-sized package. And even with all the big shiny phones that came out this year, this little baby phone with child-like specs is easily one of my favorites. It\u2019s a shame that some of the business decisions behind it mean that more people won\u2019t be able to see it for the treat is truly is.', u'Runs Android 8.0 \u2022 3.3-inch 1280 x 720 LCD display (445 PPI) \u2022 Snapdragon 435 processor \u2022 3GB of RAM \u2022 32GB of storage \u2022 802.11 a/b/g/n wi-fi \u2022 8-MP front cam \u2022 12-MP rear cam \u2022 IP68 water-resistance \u2022 Bluetooth 4.2 \u2022 800 mAh battery \u2022 3.80 x 1.99 x 0.39 inches \u2022 2.13 ounces \u2022 available in titanium or gold \u2022 supports LTE bands 2/4/5/13/17/66', u' Added more information regarding the Palm\u2019s SIM tray and the phone\u2019s carrier exclusivity.', u"Senior reporter at Gizmodo, formerly Tom's Guide and Laptop Mag.

{'text': [u'News of this week\u2019s so-called \u201c', u'\u201d might deeply trouble you. If so, that means it\u2019s a perfect time to take control of your personal security. Yes, every company should be held responsible for practicing sloppy security, allowing your sensitive data to get into the wrong hands. But at this point, there\u2019s really no reason to trust the bastards to do the right thing.', u'Roughly 21 million unique passwords were dumped online this week. The users who have little to worry about are the ones who, at the very least, have enabled some type of ', u', the simplest being two-factor authentication or \u201c2FA.\u201d Even better off are those who\u2019ve also adopted a reliable password manager, which allows them to create very long, complex, and unique passwords for each site they log into. Add in a physical security key, and you can sleep easy tonight.', u'Here\u2019s a quick(ish) rundown of the three most important pieces of crafting a healthy security routine and never sweating another password leak.', u'While 2FA isn\u2019t perfect, it\u2019s been widely adopted, and it\u2019s also very easy to use. ', u'2FA works like this: You go to login to, say, your email account, and after entering your password, it prompts you to enter a code that\u2019s been sent to your phone by text. (We\u2019ll get into better alternatives than text in a moment.) What this does, theoretically, is prevent anyone from accessing your account doesn\u2019t (a) know your password and (b) have physical access to your phone. So if your password gets leaked, it becomes not so big of a deal, and if you miss the news about a breach that may impact you, you\u2019re pretty much covered.', u'Nowadays, even my technologically challenged grandmother, whose online footprint is next to nil, knows that she can\u2019t log into her email account, or her bank account, or anything else really, without inputting that little code sent to her phone. If an 85-year-old who still pays her bills with a paper check every month can grasp this concept, then dammit, so can you!', u'Nearly every major online service offers 2FA. I\u2019ll leave it to you to figure out where the option is located for whichever service you\u2019re trying to lock down (try \u2018security\u2019 under \u2018preferences\u2019 or \u2018settings\u2019), but I\u2019ll add this: If you\u2019re using a service that requires you to volunteer sensitive information, and the only security it offers is a password, then you should definitely stop using it. Bottom line: This is obviously a company that doesn\u2019t give a shit about your security and is likely taking too few steps to protect you.', u'The reason \u201cbreaches\u201d like this week\u2019s get so much attention is that they appear to leave tens of millions of people exposed. It\u2019s easy to feel outrage at the companies that should\u2019ve safeguarded this information better. But the mindset that users bear no responsibility to protect themselves is both dangerous and lazy. There\u2019s a term everyone in 2019 should come to understand, and that\u2019s \u201csecurity hygiene.\u201d', u'I said that 2FA isn\u2019t perfect, so I\u2019ll elaborate: Most 2FA services involve sending security codes, typically 5-6 digits, via a text message (SMS). It\u2019s been ', u' ', u' that, while saf-', u', this method of receiving the code is far from foolproof. One way to improve 2FA is to use an authenticator app on your phone. (You can download Google Authenticator, for instance, on the Apple ', u' and Google ', u'.) These apps will spit out time-sensitive security codes instead of sending one by text message. Many services, but unfortunately not all, will offer you the option of using an authenticator app instead of SMS for 2FA.', u'Password managers are the second line of defense in these situations. You\u2019ve probably been told repeatedly not to reuse passwords, and if you aren\u2019t using a password manager, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve broken this rule once or twice or always. It\u2019s near impossible, without some mnemonic device, to generate unique, complex passwords for every online service you use and remember them at all times. The best way to ensure you\u2019re always using strong passwords, therefore, is to install a password manager, which does the hard parts for you. There are several, but ', u' and ', u' both work fine.', u'Password managers allow you to create very long and complex passwords, and then basically forget they exist. The only password you\u2019ll need to remember is the one that lets you access the manager itself. Obviously, make it a good one (and here\u2019s ', u' for how to do that). A lengthy, complex password is pivotal in situations where passwords are leaked (unless they\u2019re leaked in plain text). In many cases, a leak will involve passwords that are scrambled using a weak or antiquated encryption protocol, such as MD5. This requires an attacker to ', u' (or decrypt) these \u201chashed\u201d passwords. The longer and more complex a password is, the more difficult this becomes.', u'Password managers might seem risky at first, basically like you\u2019re betting everything on this one password, hoping it doesn\u2019t get stolen or cracked. But any worthy password manager will also allow you to enable some form of multi-factor authentication. Here\u2019s a list, for example, of 2FA services offered by LastPass:', u'One thing I\u2019ll add, since I\u2019ve mentioned the LastPass password manager in particular several times, is that in order to use a physical token, you\u2019ll need to have the paid version. And that\u2019ll cost you, at the time of writing, a whopping $2 per month.', u'This may sound like a hassle, but password managers are actually incredibly convenient. Once logged in, it will automatically input passwords for you. Password manager phone apps are particularly convenient because typing long, complex passwords on tiny keyboards can be infuriating. What\u2019s more, in lieu of a password, which you\u2019ll still use in your browser, you can use Touch or Face ID to unlock your password manager on your phone.', u'If relying on a password manager still frightens you, you\u2019re in luck. There\u2019s another step you can take to protect yourself while using one, and this is also what I would recommend doing personally: Buy a Yubikey or a Google ', u'. Actually, buy two.', u'Yubikey and Titan are \u201cphysical security tokens,\u201d each of which contains a private encryption key. When you enable the physical security key option with your password manager, neither you\u2014nor anyone else\u2014will be able to access your account without it. This means that in order to hack your account, an attacker would require (a) your password, (b) access to your unlocked phone, and (c) your Yubikey.', u'This also means you can\u2019t afford to lose your security key (and that\u2019s why it\u2019s best to buy them in pairs.)', u'If you\u2019re buying a security key for the first time (or looking to upgrade), pick up either the ', u' or the Google Titan key. Unlike older Yubikeys, the Series 5 version includes NFC as well as USB, while the Titan includes a Bluetooth dongle and a USB dongle. Why do you need both? Because those options make it so you can use them with any phone.', u'Your email account is the one thing you really can\u2019t afford to have breached. Not only does it likely contain a slew of private communications, it opens up the possibility of other accounts being breached through password recovery. A physical security token will basically reduce this threat to a nonexistent level. Notably, both Yubikeys and Google\u2019s Titan key can also be used to secure your social media accounts\u2014requiring someone to have that physical token before they can log into your Facebook or Twitter accounts.', u'If all of this is new to you, it probably seems like... a lot. But once you\u2019re set, it\u2019ll take no longer than a couple of days before your new security routine is second nature.', u'If news of this morning\u2019s breach left you shook, and you\u2019re worried someone might at this moment be accessing something deeply personal to you, a photo, a letter, or possibly some artful nudes, then it\u2019s time to come into the fold.

{'text': [u'When Apple announced a bunch of new iPhones', u' without mentioning any other devices, things sort of felt incomplete. So now, nearly two months later, Apple is coming back around to finish the job with a number of hardware refreshes highlighted by a pair of new iPad Pros.', u'Like rumors ', u', the biggest change on the new iPad Pros is the loss of the traditional front-mounted home button in exchange for slimmer bezels and Face ID. This move follows in the footsteps of the iPhone X and iPhone XS, and continues to pave the way for an all Face ID future from Apple, whether you like it or not.', u'That said, by reducing extra features on the front of the tablet, Apple was able to increase the iPad Pro\u2019s screen size from 10.5 to 11-inches on the smaller model, while also reducing the overall size of larger 12.9-inch version, which retains the same screen size as before.', u'Thankfully, even with the iPad Pro\u2019s new slimmer dimensions, Apple still had enough room to hide the tablet\u2019s Face ID sensors in its bezels, instead of sticking out into the display using some sort of notch. Additionally, while the iPad Pro\u2019s new Face ID sensor is positioned across the top of the tablet when in landscape orientation, Apple claims you\u2019ll be able to unlock the device in portrait mode too without issue.', u'Inside, the new iPad Pros are powered by Apple\u2019s new A12X Bionic chip which boasts an 8-Core CPU and a 7-core GPU that the company claims is 35 percent faster when performing single-core tasks and 90 percent faster in multi-core workloads. And on the storage side, Apple says the new iPad Pros can be configured with up to 1TB of storage.', u'However, one of the most fundamental changes for long-time iPad users is that the new iPad Pros are ditching Apple\u2019s traditional Lightning port for USB-C. This has several advantages such as the ability to send out 5K video to external monitors, faster data transfer, and speedier charging. But the real neat trick is that Apple says the iPad Pro\u2019s USB-C port can also be used to reverse charge other devices like an iPhone (assuming you have the necessary USB-C to Lighting cable).', u' Sadly, it seems Apple\u2019s courage regarding headphone jacks (or lack thereof) has claimed another victim now that the iPad Pro\u2019s lone USB-C port will be its only option for connectivity. ', u'If new specs weren\u2019t enough, the iPad Pro\u2019s stylus is also getting an update in the form of the new Apple Pencil. Now you\u2019ll be able to tap and swipe along the side of the pen to do things like change fonts or stroke weights. And when you need to recharge the new Pencil, you can attach it magnetically to the side of the iPad Pro, which also doubles as a way to store the Pencil when it\u2019s not in use. And as a final nod to Apple\u2019s continuous quests towards simplicity, the company has streamlined the Pencil 2\u2019s design by removing the thin strip of metal found on previous models.', u'Apple didn\u2019t forget about the iPad Pro\u2019s keyboard either, as the Smart Folio has been updated with a new Smart Connector on its back that uses 102 magnets to attach and communicate with an iPad Pro. This should make connecting the keyboard a much simpler process, and with a new second angle of adjustment, it should be easier to use an iPad Pro in awkward environments like an airplane tray table. Unfortunately, it seems the new Smart Folio still doesn\u2019t have a touchpad, which means you\u2019ll still have to rely on an Apple Pencil for more precise movements.', u'The new 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $800, while the 12.9-inch iPad Pro starts at $1,000. Pre-orders for both are live today, with shipments going out starting November 7th.', u"Senior reporter at Gizmodo, formerly Tom's Guide and Laptop Mag.

Gab refused to take it down. PayPal told Gizmodo that it did not threaten to discontinue Gab\u2019s service as a result of that outreach, and Gab said it hasn\u2019t heard back from PayPal since they messaged the payment processor 11 days ago. ', u'Sex, not violence, appears to be the bigger issue for Gab\u2014and for Stripe.', u'While Gab losing its support from certain payment processors seems, at face value, to be a deserving consequence for a platform teeming with hate speech and calls for violence, Stripe\u2019s policy goes beyond just punishing those for being shitty. In fact, payment processors\u2019 policies banning adult content are unfortunate examples of how financial institutions discriminate against sex workers.', u'\u201cFinancial discrimination is a huge issue for sex workers and extremely under reported in the media,\u201d Survivors Against SESTA, a campaign advocating for the rights and safety of sex workers, ', u'. \u201cRegardless of the kind of sex work they do, they\u2019re at risk of losing their livelihood at any minute when kicked off a platform.

Among the listed companies are a number of payment processors, including Stripe and PayPal. \u201cPayPal has banned many people for life even if they never used PayPal for their sex related work,\u201d Survivors Against SESTA wrote, while also quoting a section of Stripe\u2019s terms of service.', u'While Gab is hardly a sympathetic victim, this issue does point out the flaw in Stripe\u2019s policy. Simply put: Gab sucks, but so do Stripe\u2019s terms of service. It doesn\u2019t just impact Nazis and misogynists, but also vulnerable communities.
