{'text': u'Face Unlock for Five Year\xa0OldsOnePlusBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 21, 2017How does Face Unlock work? We explain it to you like you\u2019re five years old.When you set up Face Unlock for the first time, the front camera takes pictures of your face. The processor saves information about your face, like the distance between your eyes, on your phone for later use.To use Face Unlock, you have to wake the phone. One way to do this is to double tap the screen.At the bottom of the screen, there is a smiley icon. If your phone has Face Unlock on, then the smiley will appear.The front camera looks at your face and software follows a set of rules to compare your face to the image information you saved during the set-up process.The software looks at 100 parts of your face and checks for a certain number of matches. Face Unlock works with eyeglasses or hairstyle changes because the software looks at points all over your face.The software also checks for shadows and reflections to make sure it\u2019s seeing a real person and not a picture. If enough tests are passed, then the software will send a command to unlock your phone.Face Unlock takes only 0.4 seconds to unlock your phone and take you to the home screen. That\u2019s faster than the blink of an eye. Try it for yourself on the OnePlus 5T \U0001f609', 'title': u'Face Unlock for Five Year\xa0Olds'}

{'text': u"How I bypassed the face-unlock security on my OnePlus\xa06?Aditya AnandBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingDec 13, 2018I have always been critical of uploading images online. I was having a discussion with one of my friend regarding people uploading their images mindlessly on social network websites like Facebook, Instagram and other. In a world where we use facial-recognition features on a daily basis it can be pretty dangerous and from there I got the idea to write this article when I tried to explain it to him how images uploaded online can have an adverse affect on our lives.IntroductionFacial Unlock feature has been proven to be insecure time and time again. There have been claims about how security researchers have found creative ways to bypass the security and I was always amazed by the level of sophistication it took to carry them out, but there were some which found out ways truly easy and simple to carry out the hack. This is my story how I carried out the easiest but the most effective hack that lead me to bypass the facial-unlock feature of OnePlus 6.Let\u2019s dig\xa0in!So, to first bypass security mechanisms set in place we need to understand how these facial recognition feature works. The time we are scanning our face for the facial recognition feature, the phone takes clues about the distance of our facial feature in regards from each other, like how far our eyes is to our nose or the distance between the lips and chin and above all it makes a boundary line for our face.Let me show you what I mean. See the lines and dots it is using to map my face and make a structural note of it.don\u2019t focus on the\xa0face!This gave me an idea and it struck out of the blue that this doesn't account in the 3-D depth of my face, so anything that has the same size and features as of my face on a 2-D surface should also bypass the facial-recogntion security of my phone.The hack!So, I straight away opened up the passport size photo that I has saved for official purposes and pointed it towards my locked OnePlus 6. Let me show you the settingI enlarged my passport size photo and placed it in front of my OnePlus 6 in locked screen state and then viola!It took me 1 failed attempt and in the very next attempt I was able to open up my phone.MoralFace Unlock features have always been debated in the security world and shouldn\u2019t be used if you really care about security. Most of the phones have fell prey to this.On the security front I would recommend using iPhone X as it is secure when it comes to these things. They have surpassed various tests with flying colours ( as of now! ).If you enjoyed it please do clap and happy hacking!Twitter\xa0: twitter.com/aditya12anandLinkedIn\xa0: linkedin.com/in/aditya12anand/E-mail\xa0: aditya12anand@protonmail.comP.S.If you guys wants a video demonstrating how I carried out the hack then let me know, I will provide a video link below.", 'title': u'How I bypassed the face-unlock security on my OnePlus\xa06?'}

{'text': u'Will Biometric Logins Replace Your Passwords?Daniel BurrusBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 27, 201653% of us forget crucial passwords more than once a week. Does this sound familiar to\xa0you?Bank notes and silver coins are starting to feel incredibly primitive or quaint at best to an increasing number of shoppers. Many are happier using their credit or debt card for both their online and offline purchases. Now that the U.S. has joined Europe and other nations by requiring a chip-in-card system, the pressure is on technology to increase security and at the same time replace other annoyances from our past such as PINs and the dreaded passwords.An estimated 53% of us forget crucial passwords more than once a week. Does this sound familiar to you? These forgetful episodes often involve us losing more than 10 minutes that we will never get back as we embark on the cumbersome reset of our account process. This often leads to shoppers abandoning their purchase through sheer frustration, while others miss out on buying concert tickets to a show that sells out in record time.With our login details written down on pieces of paper or notebooks, there is also a serious security issue that needs addressing. The road to progress involves improving the current process by making life simpler for consumers while also increasing security to prevent hacking or loss of personal data.I have been writing about the use of multiple biometric identification as a more secure method of authentication. Despite many thinking this technology would be nothing more than Hollywood fantasy, Apple\u2019s latest smartphone changed that for the masses when it introduced both biometric identification and its Apple Pay system using tokenization. In an effort to keep credit cards from fading into history, MasterCard recently announced that they were beginning a phased launch of the first biometric corporate credit card program across Canada and the U.S.This technology will enable cardholders to verify transactions using facial recognition and fingerprint biometrics when making online purchases. The ethos of both Apple and MasterCard is that consumers shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice convenience for security. Each and every one of us is unique, so what could be more secure than enabling the person to become the password?The concepts of taking a selfie or scanning a fingerprint to authenticate our bank account is no longer an expensive or controversial idea. Amazon also hit the headlines recently after filing a patent that would enable its customers to pay by taking a selfie. Only 12 months ago, many would probably have scoffed at such a suggestion, but as I have pointed out in previous articles, the military has been using facial recognition for some time now with great success.A few weeks ago, mobile payments technology stole the show at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. Swiping or tapping our way through checkouts using wearables or even smart clothes seemed to promote the idea that nothing is impossible, and that there is no such thing as a bad idea.The Visa Token Service (VTS) offers a slightly different approach to the future of payments by replacing the 16-digit credit card number with a unique digital identifier that can be placed inside wearables, clothes, and appliances through the obligatory Visa Ready partners.When looking at the future of mobile payments, digital wallets often dominate conversations, but our future offers much more than smartphones with Touch ID. It has recently been estimated that one billion users will access banking services through biometric systems by 2017. If this prediction comes to fruition, we can expect an incredible level of growth in the biometrics industry.The success of this technology will largely depend on user adoption rates and if they are ready to embrace a digital world where they pay for items with a fingerprint and/or a selfie, as well as adding their voice and heartbeat pattern\u200a\u2014\u200ato name a couple more proven biometrics\u200a\u2014\u200awhen additional security is needed. When MasterCard launched its first worldwide pilot of this technology in Holland, it discovered the overwhelmingly positive news that nine out of 10 participants reported they would like to replace their password with biometric identification.The pilot users interestingly highlighted how users preferred fingerprints and facial recognition authentication to the out-of-favor passwords. This suggests that adoption of this new way of authenticating will not be as difficult as some believe.Physical cash, PINs and passwords are all beginning to look a little dated. It shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise to see multiple biometrics being embraced by both users and businesses. It appears that the biggest dilemma coming our way in the near future will be if we will use a smarter credit card or have all our cards in a smarter smartphone.

The credit reporting agencies Experian and TransUnion are data giants on par with Equifax and there are thousands of other data brokers that also possess large databanks. Data breaches like this one are not bugs, but rather features of a system that centralises immense amounts of valuable personal data in one place.Sadowski continues:The vaults of these databanks are impossible to secure, in large part, because the wealth of information they hold is a beacon for hackers. Even the most impenetrable cybersecurity will eventually fail under the pressure of dogged hackers probing for weaknesses to exploit. Better cybersecurity is important, but it is not a solution.

{'text': u'Hackathon ideas: biometric authentication for parliament voting gets first prize plus all the\xa0restA lot of excellent and inspiring ideas were proposed at the BlockchainUA Hackathon and we would like to make a short overview of them for our community.REMMEBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingOct 11, 2018The winner of the hackathon was team R2R1 which proposed to members of the Ukrainian parliament and government a system for scanning fingerprints for obtaining REMME TLS/SSL certificates and authenticating using them while voting in the parliament. The team proposed performing the voting procedure using the third party blockchain to increase the level of transparency. The jury noted that the integration of REMME digital certificates with biometric information has broad potential for application in a wide range of areas.Second place at the hackathon went jointly to two projects, one of which is also related to human biometrics. The R3 team proposed encrypting biometric data directly into the hash of a private key, which potentially could allow for authentication using REMME, where the certificate is contained in the user\u2019s thumbnail image or eye retina. At the hackathon, only the idea itself was presented via a broad demonstration, with the work on its actual realization to be done if the developers decide to continue work on it.Another idea is the implementation of REMME as an open standard for authorization of a mobile application, as was proposed by team M2R2. When work on OAuth is completed, it can be used like Google authentication on any platform or mobile application, enabling the platform owner to make access to their service more secure and simple.Two other teams took third place. One solution from the Mr. Bunny team was to use REMME for contactless authentication in an ATM, and in the second, Light Wallet team developed an advanced version of REMME WebAuth that has the following functions: manage certificates, transfer tokens and check transactions.In addition to the main nominees, the Gribtsyi team developed a submarine swap at the hackathon, which has an application for the use of lightning networks for off-chain transactions. The concept of using REMME to implement such a swap was presented, and the team also prepared a document that would be useful for the current development of one of the key components of REMME\u200a\u2014\u200aatomic swaps.The REMME protocol was also proposed for implementing digital ticket signing for various events. This would enable the event organizer to track resale and to receive an additional commission from each subsequent sale. The tickets themselves were realized in the form of ERC721 tokens. With the ERC721 standard, each token is completely unique and non-interchangeable with other tokens.Certain teams are planning to continue work on their solutions, and the REMME tech team will support them. You are welcome to join one of the working groups around presented concepts after the first prototypes are ready.Thank you for being with us! Stay tuned and join our Tech community!The actual development process can be checked in the dev branch.Releases are for significant functionality changes only.REMME\u2019s official links:Website: https://remme.io/Telegram group: https://t.me/remmeApply to join Tech Community: https://remme.io/communityTelegram news channel: https://t.me/remme_dailyTwitter: https://twitter.com/remme_ioReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/remme/', 'title': u'Hackathon ideas: biometric authentication for parliament voting gets first prize plus all the\xa0rest'}

{'text': u'7 Trends in Biometric Technology as It Applies to\xa0FinTechMEDICIBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 12, 2016Mitigating the risk of a security breach and protecting customer data is one of many concerns that need to be addressed with innovative technological solutions and methods. Biometric authentication is one such solution to this problem. With rapid innovation in this field, new companies and use cases are coming up in order to provide secure and convenient authentication processes to users.Governments and various industries are trying to implement mobile biometrics to speed up the process of biometric authentication. Individual biometric identification can be achieved on a mobile device either through its built-in biometric sensors or by attaching portable biometric hardware to it via a USB cable or through a Wi-Fi connection. The global biometric authentication and identification market is expected to undergo considerable growth over the next five years. The market size for biometrics is expected to reach $24.59 billion in the next six years, according to Grand View Research.Here are some of the major technology and market trends in this segment:Biometrics is expanding to the retail and consumer market to address problems with the current PIN and password authenticationMost commonly, current authentication methods don\u2019t provide the security that is actually needed. Passwords can be hacked and socially engineered from personal information that is readily shared on social media. PINs are not unique; the 20 most common combinations represent over 25% of in-use four-digit passwords. Companies like Microsoft andIntel are implementing biometric authentication systems into their future products to protect user credentials. Biometric single sign-on (SSO) is a biometric password management technology that secures passwords & networks and protects data from unauthorized access & security breaches.Smartphone manufacturers are turning to biometrics to authenticate device\xa0accessThe number of global biometric smartphone users will rise to 471M in 2017, up from 43.23M last year. (Source:Biometrics Go Mobile: A Market Overview). According to Gartner, 30% of mobile devices will be using biometric authentication by 2016.Biometric modalities fueling the growth in consumer and retail are focused more on convenience than\xa0securityThere are different modes/methods of biometric authentication such as fingerprint, voice, retina, heartbeat, facial and others. Fingerprint biometrics, the least secure modality, is becoming mainstream with annual sensor shipments estimated at 1.4 billion units by 2020, up from 317 million in 2014. Bank of America recently introduced fingerprint and Touch ID sign-in for its mobile banking apps. With this feature, customers can use their fingerprints as a passcode for their mobile banking app. The main aim behind this new authentication facility is to provide its customers with secure and convenient banking. The new feature from banks will remove the need of text-based passcodes from users.Biometric authentication in\xa0paymentsBiometric solutions are being deployed for multiple payment use cases, including leveraging smartphones for POS purchases and using biometrics as a second form of authentication at ATMs. For example, Apple Pay is making mobile POS payments via smartphones much more secure by using fingerprinting in its Apple TouchID biometric system to verify a user\u2019s identity and simplify the online and mobile process. Earlier, Touch ID was limited to the App Store, iTunes purchases and unlocking the device. The announcement caught the attention of banks and we witnessed Touch ID being used for accessing mobile banking services. Some of the banks who have already adopted Touch ID in their mobile banking apps are American Express, ING Bank, OutBank DE and Deutsche Bank.Biometrics for mobile\xa0bankingBiometric authentication seems to be an absolute must-have in the near future for banks, especially taking into consideration how mobile banking is getting popular. It seems to be a milestone when considering the future of mobile applications. If banks desire to remain competitive, they should anticipate customers\u2019 expectations and needs. However, the key idea is to combine innovations with taking care of clients\u2019 convenience and payments\u2019 safety.Multifactor biometric authenticationOrganizations are now seriously considering multifactor biometrics like fingerprint, retina, voice, retina, facial and heartbeat for authentication as it has a lot of significance in online/mobile banking. Banks have started working with technology firms, developers and startups in order to create fool-proof authentication systems which will be the key to a great mobile banking and mobile payments experience. Wells Fargo is the first US-based financial institution to pilot a fusion of voice and face biometrics to authenticate customers, a feature that is being rolled-out to CEO Mobile\u2019s iPhone app users in 2016. By identifying a customer\u2019s face, voice and mobile device, biometric authentication makes it extremely difficult to spoof the true user.Industry-specialized biometric solutionsVarious kinds of solutions are designed to meet the unique demand of respective industries. The solutions are customized according to the local and international industrial laws and standards. For example, CertisID provides a specialized biometric solution for the financial services industry. It is designed to provide security and reduce fraud, providing a complete audit trail for both customer and employee activity. Another example is RightPatient, a company in the healthcare sector that facilitates a higher level of accuracy for patient identification, and unifies big data and clinical knowledge in healthcare in an unprecedented way to drive personalized health, decision support and predictive analytics.Originally published: 7 Trends in Biometric Technology as It Applies to FinTech', 'title': u'7 Trends in Biometric Technology as It Applies to\xa0FinTech'}

{'text': u'Biometric Password Authentication In Future For Samsung SmartwatchesTech NewsBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFeb 8, 2016Users might witness biometric passwords for Samsung wearables in the future, providing the security that can not be breached by anyone\xa0else.Samsung Electronics has never stayed behind when it comes to providing its customers with the best innovative technology today. It has never hesitated to bring out technology, which has not been witnessed before, and it might continue doing so in the years to come. There have been speculations that the South Korean tech giant might provide further the security to wearable lovers unbreachable by anyone but them; smart watches will consist of a biometric verification authentication.The Galaxy maker will provide security to its customers that will require only their vein patterns and pulse to get access to their wearables in the future. According to a patent filling to the Trademark Office, the tech company described a technology that will consist of light sensors with a camera sensor in order identify vein pattern of users and detects their pulse.This description of the system indicates that the Samsung smart watches will consist of a biometric-like security because the combo of a camera and a light sensor prove that biometric tech will be installed in the watches. This can go very well if the company plays its cards right, especially with the mobile payments application, providing users with the security they seek for in the day today.Digitalization has not just led to success but also boosted cybercrime to access user\u2019s confidential and sensitive data for benefits. With technology of such a kind, it would be difficult to \u201capparently\u201d hack such a device.Biometric verification will offer customization of users contact list with different ringtones once the user identification is verified. The function is highly similar to fingerprint scanner. Infrared technology might be used by Samsung to reach this goal, as this is the only technology that can identify the pattern of the user\u2019s veins.Previous speculations of patents suggested Samsung might use the user\u2019s heartbeat as a verification tool but that would be very hard and unreliable. Heartbeat can vary from time to time depending on the situation and condition of a person. This would be an \u2018awkward\u2019 situation for the South Korean organization but the recent speculation seems reliable, as veins cannot change under any circumstance.Samsung device detects veins by the smart watch if the user is wearing one, indicating that this biometric tech will relieve the owner in terms of security of their data, no matter where they go. This marks a significant milestone in cybersecurity and data protection.', 'title': u'Biometric Password Authentication In Future For Samsung Smartwatches'}

{'text': u'The European Commission Has a BAD Idea\u200a\u2014\u200aMandatory Biometric ID\xa0CardsBozhidar BozhanovBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingApr 28, 2018After Article 13 that mandates upload filters, the European Commission has another ill-advised proposal\u200a\u2014\u200anow they want to make biometric data in ID cards mandatory for all member states.Counter-terrorism, security, blah-blah\u2026 I don\u2019t doubt they may be meaning well, but the technical details are just too complicated for the average politician to comprehend (and our politicians are very average, if I may quote \u201cYes, Minister\u201d).When I was advisor to the Bulgarian deputy prime minister I did extensive research on the issues of identity documents, as we were changing the Bulgarian legislation and had to decide whether it\u2019s okay to have biometric ID cards or not (we decided to make them opt-in, which would mean practically nobody would go for that option). And I have listed the many issues with electronic machine readable travel documents (eMRTDs) but let me make a simplified overview of why the ICAO standard is bad (and I\u2019m joined in this opinion by many security researchers, whose papers I\u2019ve quoted in the linked article): the certificates and keys used to read the the fingerprints in the documents are stored in the terminal equipment (automatic or not) and are rotated frequently, because if they leak (and they can leak), then every passport in the world can be read with the single leaked key. And the fact that they are rotated frequently (which means\u200a\u2014\u200athey are invalid after a day or two) doesn\u2019t help, because the chips in passports don\u2019t have clocks. If they are not validated often, they become stale and the fingerprints can be read by keys whose certificates have expired a long time ago.\u201cBut the chip is NFC and can be read only in close proximity\u201d you may say. Wrong. There is equipment (that\u2019s easy and cheap to make) that fits in a backpack that can read up to a few meters. So in practice\u200a\u2014\u200ayou walk around the metro/subway train and collect fingerprints. It is not that trivial, of course, it requires some brute-forcing and advanced knowledge of the ICAO protocol (guess what\u200a\u2014\u200achips can\u2019t prevent brute-force attacks), but it is doable.So far I\u2019ve talked about passports. The good thing about them is that you don\u2019t carry them with you unless you are flying outside the EU. So very few people will have their passports on them at a given moment. They are still vulnerable in \u201ctrain to the airport\u201d scenarios, but passports are validated more often because you use them to cross borders.ID cards have none of these benefits. You carry them all the time and they never go through border inspections (within the Schengen area at least). So they almost always have stale clocks.Additionally, some countries may decide to make a fingerprint database when they collect the fingerprints of citizens for issuing the document. This database, no matter how well protected, can leak at some point. It is not technically required to have the database when issuing documents (you can write the fingerprint on the chip and then discard it), but some countries will inevitably store them unless explicitly restricted.What can happen if someone has your fingerprint? It was a bit disheartening when (at a conference) an expert in passports answered my concerns with \u201cwell, nothing bad can happen if someone gets your fingerprint\u200a\u2014\u200aI can get your fingerprint from that glass you are holding\u201d. You can, but it won\u2019t be high-resolution and won\u2019t allow you to make perfect fake fingerprints (and yes, it\u2019s pretty easy to make fake fingerprints, and fingerprint-only identification is a horrible idea). And even if you could make a fake fingerprint, you won\u2019t be able to easily automate the process if you used glasses.But what can you do with those? A few things to begin with\u200a\u2014\u200aunlock stolen phones, unlock access doors (including home doors\u200a\u2014\u200athere are fingerprint locks already on the market). When you unlock a stolen phone, you have access to everything\u200a\u2014\u200aemail (which can be used to gain access to most services), the 2nd factor in most 2-factor authentications, for e-banking for example. The worse thing is that you can\u2019t change your fingerprint. And anything that relies on it is compromised forever. Your next smartphone. And the one after it. There\u2019s no \u201cinvalidate fingerprint\u201d option.The general data protection and human rights argument is also here\u200a\u2014\u200ahaving databases (whether centrally leaked or illegally collected) of biometric data is dystopian. And bad. Period.But\u2026but\u2026counter-terrorism? Ah, yes, let\u2019s get to that. Fingerprints won\u2019t help. I\u2019d be happy to see some analysis and threat models when the actual proposal is published, but I don\u2019t think fingerprints solve any actual problem.So what are the potential scenarios? A terrorists forges a document, a terrorist gets issued a fake document from a rogue/compromised state, a terrorist steals a document. Let\u2019s see whether fingerprints in the document help and whether they are needed in each scenario. But first a clarification\u200a\u2014\u200athe fingerprints in the document would be needed in order to verify that the holder of the document is actually the person to whom the document is originally issued. You match the fingerprints of the holder to the fingerprints in the document. This is the only thing the fingerprints in a document are good for. So:a terrorists forges a document \u2014if the documents has any electronic data in it, signed with the private key of the issuing country, nobody can create a fake document because it won\u2019t pass the signature validation. You don\u2019t need fingerprints for that, you can sign the name and birth date.a terrorist gets issued a fake document from a rogue/compromised state\u200a\u2014\u200aif a terrorist can have a document issued with a genuine private key from an actual country, then they can issue perfectly valid document under a fake name with the actual fingerprints and pass fingerprint verification. How about checking the fingerprints against a database? Well, you don\u2019t need them in the document\u200a\u2014\u200ayou have the person in front of you, giving their fingerprints for inspection anyway.a terrorist steals a document\u200a\u2014\u200ain that case, upon inspection, the fingerprints in the document won\u2019t match the ones of the person. So maybe this is the actual use? Well, you don\u2019t need them here either. There\u2019s the photo (which I have no objections to being stored) which should also match. Yes, both automatic and human inspections can be fooled with similarly-looking people, but how likely is it? Also, stolen and lost documents are normally reported (not all of them, though) and are/can be distributed in central databases of invalid documents.Only in the last case there\u2019s some room for fingerprints. But when would the inspection be done? At airpoirts\u200a\u2014\u200aon arrival you can go through automatic gates and use fake fingerprint anyway, so that\u2019s not something you are solving. On departure\u200a\u2014\u200ayou are checked for dangerous items anyway, so even with a fake document you should not be able to crash a plane. I\u2019m reminding again that in Schengen there\u2019s no border checks, so the only way someone can inspect your ID cards would be for police officers to be patrolling railway and bus stations and asking strangers to give their fingerprints. Which means they will have to carry fingerprint readers (with the short-lived key+certificate).When I was in the cabinet we mailed both ICAO and the European Commission most of the above concerns. The responses we got were\xa0\u2026 disappointing. The Commission replied: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had problems so far\u201d. Best. Security. Approach. Ever. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had problems, therefore it\u2019s secure\u201d. No.ICAO showed more understanding and replied \u201cThank you, can you recommend an expert for a working group\u201d (we didn\u2019t for various reasons out of the scope of this article).This brings me to the bigger issue with legislation that requires technical expertise. Political decisions should be taken with the details in mind. The \u201cgeneral overview\u201d and the \u201cexecutive summary\u201d are not sufficient when it comes to affecting millions of citizens.I hope I\u2019m missing something. But my hunch is that this is all nonsense which will hopefully be killed by the European Parliament.', 'title': u'The European Commission Has a BAD Idea\u200a\u2014\u200aMandatory Biometric ID\xa0Cards'}

NSF-supported researchers will present a paper, Cardiac Scan: A Non-contact and Continuous Heart-based User Authentication System highlighting a new biometric computer security device that measures the dimensions of the heart and uses this information as a personal identifier.\u201cHeart-based biometrics systems have been used for almost a decade,\u201d says Wenyao Xu of University of Buffalo, the paper\u2019s lead author, in a recent news release issued by the university. But, he said \u201cNo one has done a non-contact remote device to characterize our hearts\u2019 geometry traits for identification.\u201dImage credit: Jurga Jot/Shutterstock.comCurrent biometrics rely on electrodes measuring electrocardiogram signals, which means they must physically touch users to obtain heart readings. An example of a device that requires physical contact is Nymi, a wearable wristband created in 2013 that recognizes a user\u2019s unique cardiac rhythms.Xu\u2019s device, called Cardiac Scan, uses low-level Doppler radar to measure the heart\u200a\u2014\u200aits shape, size, and how it moves\u200a\u2014\u200ato identify an individual.Every heart is unique. Xu\u2019s device could relieve people\u2019s concerns about leaving their computers unguarded because Cardiac Scan constantly monitors users.

{'text': u'Biometric technology: Looking to the\xa0futureSecurity ResponseBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingSep 27, 2017Welcome to Threat Intel\u2019s #WednesdayWisdom column, which aims to help improve your cyber security knowledge and keep you informed on important developments.Issues around the security, reliability, and privacy of biometric technology were catapulted into the headlines recently when Apple introduced its new iPhone X to the masses at its annual event in California.The iPhone X is the first iPhone to utilize facial recognition technology, and its introduction has led to both privacy and security experts expressing concerns that using this technology might make it easier for people\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding law enforcement and border control officials, as well as potentially hackers\u200a\u2014\u200ato unlock people\u2019s phones, potentially against their will.Apple, of course, disputes this, and also says that the chances of a random person being able to unlock your phone with their face is one in a million.However, its introduction has brought to the fore again questions about biometric technology, and how secure it may be if used for things like unlocking your phone or making payments in shops.What is biometric technology?Dictionary.com defines biometrics as \u201cthe process by which a person\u2019s unique physical and other traits are detected and recorded by an electronic device or system as a means of confirming identity.\u201dApple\u2019s move into using facial recognition is far from the first time we have seen biometrics being used as a security feature on mobile phones\u200a\u2014\u200athe iPhone fingerprint scanner, which will be replaced on the iPhone X by the facial recognition technology, has been a feature on the iPhone since the launch of the iPhone 5s in 2013. That is something that many of us got so used to that it will be a wrench for it to be replaced with new technology, demonstrating, perhaps, how quickly the public can adapt to new types of authentication.However, as there were security concerns around fingerprint scanning technology, which it was possible to spoof, there will also be concerns about facial recognition technology. Iris scanning technology and facial recognition technology on Samsung\u2019s S8 smartphone were both cracked by researchers using photographs. This highlights one of the main issues some people have pointed out about using facial recognition for security: unlike your fingerprint, people can see your face when they\u2019re in your presence, and it is likely many photos of it exist online. This prompts some questions: could someone unlock your phone with a photo? Could people restrain you and hold up your phone to your face and unlock it that way?Apple has said that its Face ID technology means that a person\u2019s phone could not simply be unlocked with a photograph: the iPhone uses an infrared system to project a grid of 30,000 invisible light dots onto a person\u2019s face to map it in a 3D shape. You also have to look at the phone for it to unlock, so you could not hold it up to the face of its sleeping owner to unlock it. However, while this technology certainly sounds more secure than what has gone before it, it doesn\u2019t guarantee it is unhackable. The real test of it will be when the iPhone X becomes broadly available and researchers and others have a chance to test its security.Another concern around the use of biometric technology on mobile phones, which also applied to the existing fingerprint technology on so many phones, is that the law about whether or not you can be obligated by a member of the authorities to unlock your phone is a grey area. It has been established in the courts in the U.S. that, under the Fifth Amendment, an individual cannot be forced to reveal the PIN that will unlock their phone, but whether or not they can refuse to unlock it using biometrics has not been definitively established.Ultimately, while the ability to unlock devices using biometrics may offer greater convenience, it is not as secure as protecting your phone with a complex and unique PIN. If privacy is your concern, then a secure PIN is probably still the best way to protect your phone. However, it should be noted that, in the UK, convictions have been brought against individuals who have refused to hand over their passcodes when entering the country.Be still my beating\xa0heartMobile phones are far from the only area in which we are seeing biometrics being used for authentication and security.Some researchers have also recently put forth the idea of using your heartbeat to log in to computers and mobile phones. In 2015, MasterCard and Canadian biometrics company Nymi completed the first \u201cin the wild\u201d credit card transaction that was authenticated by reading the user\u2019s unique heartbeat pattern. The transaction was carried out using Nymi\u2019s dedicated payments authentication wristband. The company has claimed the technology could be built into other fitness trackers and smartwatches, and it says it can be used anywhere that accepts contactless payments.MasterCard is somewhat at the forefront when it comes to trialing ways to use biometrics to authenticate payments. At Mobile World Congress last year it introduced the idea of \u201cselfie payments\u201d, where users would take a selfie to authenticate their identity. It included this software as part of its Identity Check Mobile rollout in a number of European markets in late 2016.Ears, which have distinct characteristics unique to an individual, have also been mooted as a part of the body that could be used as a unique identifier, and even as a way to authenticate payments.Another recent story that raised eyebrows and inspired headlines was when a company microchipped its employees to allow them to scan into their offices and do things like purchase food without needing anything as old fashioned as an access card.So, will biometrics and microchipping eventually mean that we no longer need passwords or ID cards and our body will literally be what identifies us? Time will tell.However, while the advantages of biometrics are, of course, that they are much harder to guess or spoof, the problems are that if your biometric identity is compromised somehow there is little you can do about it\u200a\u2014\u200ait is a lot more difficult to change your face, heartbeat, or gait than a password.Predicting the\xa0futureAs biometric technology advances, many people are naturally asking what will be next? In the always fast-moving world of tech it is hard to say. But some observers have speculated that Apple\u2019s face tracking will lead to people becoming more accustomed to having their faces tracked, with the potential in the future to have technology that not only recognizes your face, but could perhaps even predict how you are feeling from your facial expression.However, the Minority Report style future that sort of speculation brings to mind is probably still some time away.For now, for those purchasing the iPhone X, the best advice is probably not to put all your eggs in the facial recognition basket, but to also ensure you have a good password enabled to keep your phone secure.Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to mobile phone\xa0securityCheck out the Security Response blog and follow Threat Intel on Twitter to keep up-to-date with the latest happenings in the world of threat intelligence and cybersecurity.Like this story?

{'text': u'3 Industries that Need iTrue\u2019s Biometric Authentication SystemiTrue.ioBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingAug 20, 2018There is a growing demand for safe, efficient, and secure authentication systems, given the rise of online financial products and startup companies providing innovative digital services. Many organizations are already exploring or implementing biometrics as the optimal way of authenticating users in order to reduce the risk of security breaches.However, biometric technologies alone cannot give absolute assurance of secure and safe authentication since user data can easily be compromised or misused with improper handling. iTrue solves this issue by putting confidential data on the blockchain and securing it with biometrics. Thus, offering users a safe location to store data as well as a platform to verify identities without fear of compromise. The use case of iTrue\u2019s decentralized platform spans across many industries, but the major ones are banking and finance, healthcare and government.Banking and FinanceBanking and finance is expected to be the number one driver for growth in biometric technologies, as banks realize passwords and pins are no longer a sufficient security barrier. Michelle Moore, head of digital banking at Bank of America, told The Charlotte Observer, \u201cpasswords need to go away\u201d because \u201cnumber 1, people forget them and, number 2, they\u2019re not safe.\u201dA report from Global Market Insights predicts that use of biometric technology within financial services will grow by 22 percent per year between 2017 and\xa02024.Fingerprint recognitionAccording to the American Banker, more than half of Bank of America\u2019s users had used fingerprint biometrics for mobile access by 2017.Eye recognitionAccording to Fortune, dozens of regional banks and credit unions, including Wells Fargo, have already enabled app sign-on via eye recognition.Facial recognitionFor iPhone X users, U.S. Bank and Citibank offer facial ID login to their mobile banking portals given that iPhone X doesn\u2019t support fingerprint login.Biometric identification is used by banks and other financial institutions to know exactly \u2018who\u2019 is using the services they are offering and also for documenting customers\u2019 activities. With so many options available for biometric identification, banks are even moving towards offering multifactor authentication allowing customers to provide a combination of biometric identifiers (i.e. fingerprint and eye scans) to reduce the potential of fraud even further.Key use cases for financial institutions:\xb7 Customer identification\xb7 Employee identification\xb7 KYC compliance\xb7 ATM access\xb7 Mobile banking accessHealthcareHealthcare biometrics refers to biometric applications in doctors\u2019 offices, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities for use in monitoring patients, but also for healthcare insurance and patient record keeping.To start, healthcare professionals spend a lot of time on patient identification, record keeping and retrieval of patient records. These processes can be streamlined with biometric authentication as a single facial scan can pull up all related patient data, saving valuable time that can be spent providing care and treatment to other patients.According to the BMJ, hospital medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United\xa0States.Furthermore, emergency patients are often unconscious and cannot produce an ID or answer critical questions like drug-related allergies or current medications. Traditional patient tagging is full of vulnerabilities and a simple error can lead to loss of life, therefore keeping this process free from flaws becomes mandatory. Biometric identification can help achieve this level of accuracy in patient identification.A hospital has many areas where only doctors and staff should enter. Biometrics can help prevent unauthorized access to critical areas such as operating rooms or PCs that contain confidential patient records.Key use cases for healthcare facilities:\xb7 Patient access control\xb7 Patient identification\xb7 Patient tagging\xb7 Workforce management\xb7 Healthcare insurance\xb7 Patient record storageGovernmentBiometrics has received increased attention since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and has intensified over time due to mass shootings and other dangerous happenings around the world. Governments are increasingly turning to biometrics in an attempt to increase security at airports and border crossings, and to produce more secure identity documents. Some governments are even relying on biometric technology to verify voters during government elections.In the summer of 2018, Heathrow Airport travellers faced huge queues of up to 2.5 hours when going through passport control and\xa0securityMoreover, governments deal with a lot of confidential documents that are currently stored in centralized locations and servers. All this confidential data\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding biometric data\u200a\u2014\u200acan be stolen or tampered with if the single location were ever compromised by intruders.Key use cases for governments:\xb7 National identification programs (i.e. India, United Kingdom)\xb7 Public food distribution systems (i.e. India, Venezuela)\xb7 ePassports (i.e. Canada, United States)\xb7 Voters\u2019 enrollment (i.e. Brazil, Portugal)\xb7 Border control (i.e. Canada, United States)\xb7 Prisons and detention centers (i.e. United States, United Kingdom)', 'title': u'3 Industries that Need iTrue\u2019s Biometric Authentication System'}

As you already know, the Face ID technology was introduced together with the release of iPhone X, and Touch ID came with the iPhone 5s and is still available in the latest iPhone 8.LocalAuthenticationThe LocalAuthentication framework enables us to request authentication from users through passphrases or biometrics. Because you can't have both Face ID and Touch ID on a single device, Apple has kept everything under one simple method.All you need to do is import LocalAuthentication and then copy the following code where you need it.As I have mentioned earlier, the canEvaluatePolicy method will detect the biometrics support on the device, and present the correct Authentication feature. This kind of authentication is mostly wanted for apps that contain payments features, files storage, finances and any other kind of sensitive data.Testing on iOS SimulatorIf you have wondered how to test this feature if you don't have a physical device such as the iPhone X or iPhone 5s and later, don't worry. The iOS Simulator provides us with a feature that can bypass this kind of behavior.Click on your Simulator and then go Hardware -> Touch ID or FaceID from the top menu bar.In the submenu there will be 3 options available:Enrolled - enables the Touch ID or Face ID featureMatching Touch - successful authenticationNon-matching Touch - authentication failedThat\u2019s it from this tutorial and if it helped you please \U0001f44f or share this story so others like you can find it.
